<h3>No. 1	Guider l'attention dans les modeles de sequence a sequence pour la  prediction des actes de dialogue</h3><h4>Pierre Colombo, Emile Chapuis, Matteo Manica, Emmanuel Vignon, Giovanna Varni, Chloe Clavel</h4> Abstract: The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality. Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to the state of the art our model does not require handcrafted features and is trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on MRDA. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09419">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Is Aligning Embedding Spaces a Challenging Task? An Analysis of the  Existing Methods</h3><h4>Russa Biswas, Mehwish Alam, Harald Sack</h4> Abstract: Representation Learning of words and Knowledge Graphs (KG) into low dimensional vector spaces along with its applications to many real-world scenarios have recently gained momentum. In order to make use of multiple KG embeddings for knowledge-driven applications such as question answering, named entity disambiguation, knowledge graph completion, etc., alignment of different KG embedding spaces is necessary. In addition to multilinguality and domain-specific information, different KGs pose the problem of structural differences making the alignment of the KG embeddings more challenging. This paper provides a theoretical analysis and comparison of the state-of-the-art alignment methods between two embedding spaces representing entity-entity and entity-word. This paper also aims at assessing the capability and short-comings of the existing alignment methods on the pretext of different applications. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09247">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Refinement of Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Word Embeddings</h3><h4>Magdalena Biesialska, Marta R. Costa-jussà</h4> Abstract: Cross-lingual word embeddings aim to bridge the gap between high-resource and low-resource languages by allowing to learn multilingual word representations even without using any direct bilingual signal. The lion's share of the methods are projection-based approaches that map pre-trained embeddings into a shared latent space. These methods are mostly based on the orthogonal transformation, which assumes language vector spaces to be isomorphic. However, this criterion does not necessarily hold, especially for morphologically-rich languages. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to refine the alignment of unsupervised bilingual word embeddings. The proposed model moves vectors of words and their corresponding translations closer to each other as well as enforces length- and center-invariance, thus allowing to better align cross-lingual embeddings. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as in most cases it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in a bilingual lexicon induction task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09213">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Learning Dynamic Knowledge Graphs to Generalize on Text-Based Games</h3><h4>Ashutosh Adhikari, Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre Côté, Mikuláš Zelinka, Marc-Antoine Rondeau, Romain Laroche, Pascal Poupart, Jian Tang, Adam Trischler, William L. Hamilton</h4> Abstract: Playing text-based games requires skill in processing natural language and in planning. Although a key goal for agents solving this task is to generalize across multiple games, most previous work has either focused on solving a single game or has tackled generalization with rule-based heuristics. In this work, we investigate how structured information in the form of a knowledge graph (KG) can facilitate effective planning and generalization. We introduce a novel transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model that constructs a "belief" KG from raw text observations of the environment, dynamically updating this belief graph at every game step as it receives new observations. To train this model to build useful graph representations, we introduce and analyze a set of graph-related pre-training tasks. We demonstrate empirically that KG-based representations from our model help agents to converge faster to better policies for multiple text-based games, and further, enable stronger zero-shot performance on unseen games. Experiments on unseen games show that our best agent outperforms text-based baselines by 21.6%. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09127">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	On the impressive performance of randomly weighted encoders in  summarization tasks</h3><h4>Jonathan Pilault, Jaehong Park, Christopher Pal</h4> Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of untrained randomly initialized encoders in a general class of sequence to sequence models and compare their performance with that of fully-trained encoders on the task of abstractive summarization. We hypothesize that random projections of an input text have enough representational power to encode the hierarchical structure of sentences and semantics of documents. Using a trained decoder to produce abstractive text summaries, we empirically demonstrate that architectures with untrained randomly initialized encoders perform competitively with respect to the equivalent architectures with fully-trained encoders. We further find that the capacity of the encoder not only improves overall model generalization but also closes the performance gap between untrained randomly initialized and full-trained encoders. To our knowledge, it is the first time that general sequence to sequence models with attention are assessed for trained and randomly projected representations on abstractive summarization. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09084">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Accessing Higher-level Representations in Sequential Transformers with  Feedback Memory</h3><h4>Angela Fan, Thibaut Lavril, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar</h4> Abstract: Transformers are feedforward networks that can process input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input - the representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already built in previous time steps. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, neural machine translation, summarization, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can improve over Transformer baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09402">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Crowdsourced Collective Entity Resolution with Relational Match  Propagation</h3><h4>Jiacheng Huang, Wei Hu, Zhifeng Bao, Yuzhong Qu</h4> Abstract: Knowledge bases (KBs) store rich yet heterogeneous entities and facts. Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify entities in KBs which refer to the same real-world object. Recent studies have shown significant benefits of involving humans in the loop of ER. They often resolve entities with pairwise similarity measures over attribute values and resort to the crowds to label uncertain ones. However, existing methods still suffer from high labor costs and insufficient labeling to some extent. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called crowdsourced collective ER, which leverages the relationships between entities to infer matches jointly rather than independently. Specifically, it iteratively asks human workers to label picked entity pairs and propagates the labeling information to their neighbors in distance. During this process, we address the problems of candidate entity pruning, probabilistic propagation, optimal question selection and error-tolerant truth inference. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves superior accuracy with much less labeling. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09361">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Language as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven  Exploration</h3><h4>Cédric Colas, Tristan Karch, Nicolas Lair, Jean-Michel Dussoux, Clément Moulin-Frier, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</h4> Abstract: Autonomous reinforcement learning agents must be intrinsically motivated to explore their environment, discover potential goals, represent them and learn how to achieve them. As children do the same, they benefit from exposure to language, using it to formulate goals and imagine new ones as they learn their meaning. In our proposed learning architecture (IMAGINE), the agent freely explores its environment and turns natural language descriptions of interesting interactions from a social partner into potential goals. IMAGINE learns to represent goals by jointly learning a language model and a goal-conditioned reward function. Just like humans, our agent uses language compositionality to generate new goals by composing known ones. Leveraging modular model architectures based on Deep Sets and gated-attention mechanisms, IMAGINE autonomously builds a repertoire of behaviors and shows good zero-shot generalization properties for various types of generalization. When imagining its own goals, the agent leverages zero-shot generalization of the reward function to further train on imagined goals and refine its behavior. We present experiments in a simulated domain where the agent interacts with procedurally generated scenes containing objects of various types and colors, discovers goals, imagines others and learns to achieve them. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09253">PDF</a><h2>2020-03-10</h2>

To our knowledge, it is the first time that general sequence to sequence models with attention are assessed for trained and randomly projected representations on abstractive summarization. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09084">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Accessing Higher-level Representations in Sequential Transformers with  Feedback Memory</h3><h4>Angela Fan, Thibaut Lavril, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar</h4> Abstract: Transformers are feedforward networks that can process input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input - the representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already built in previous time steps. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, neural machine translation, summarization, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can improve over Transformer baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09402">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Crowdsourced Collective Entity Resolution with Relational Match  Propagation</h3><h4>Jiacheng Huang, Wei Hu, Zhifeng Bao, Yuzhong Qu</h4> Abstract: Knowledge bases (KBs) store rich yet heterogeneous entities and facts. Entity resolution (ER) aims to identify entities in KBs which refer to the same real-world object. Recent studies have shown significant benefits of involving humans in the loop of ER. They often resolve entities with pairwise similarity measures over attribute values and resort to the crowds to label uncertain ones. However, existing methods still suffer from high labor costs and insufficient labeling to some extent. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called crowdsourced collective ER, which leverages the relationships between entities to infer matches jointly rather than independently. Specifically, it iteratively asks human workers to label picked entity pairs and propagates the labeling information to their neighbors in distance. During this process, we address the problems of candidate entity pruning, probabilistic propagation, optimal question selection and error-tolerant truth inference. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that, compared with state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves superior accuracy with much less labeling. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09361">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Language as a Cognitive Tool to Imagine Goals in Curiosity-Driven  Exploration</h3><h4>Cédric Colas, Tristan Karch, Nicolas Lair, Jean-Michel Dussoux, Clément Moulin-Frier, Peter Ford Dominey, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</h4> Abstract: Autonomous reinforcement learning agents must be intrinsically motivated to explore their environment, discover potential goals, represent them and learn how to achieve them. As children do the same, they benefit from exposure to language, using it to formulate goals and imagine new ones as they learn their meaning. In our proposed learning architecture (IMAGINE), the agent freely explores its environment and turns natural language descriptions of interesting interactions from a social partner into potential goals. IMAGINE learns to represent goals by jointly learning a language model and a goal-conditioned reward function. Just like humans, our agent uses language compositionality to generate new goals by composing known ones. Leveraging modular model architectures based on Deep Sets and gated-attention mechanisms, IMAGINE autonomously builds a repertoire of behaviors and shows good zero-shot generalization properties for various types of generalization. When imagining its own goals, the agent leverages zero-shot generalization of the reward function to further train on imagined goals and refine its behavior. We present experiments in a simulated domain where the agent interacts with procedurally generated scenes containing objects of various types and colors, discovers goals, imagines others and learns to achieve them. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.09253">PDF</a>
