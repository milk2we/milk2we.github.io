<h3>No. 1	Improving Sampling Accuracy of Stochastic Gradient MCMC Methods via  Non-uniform Subsampling of Gradients</h3><h4>Ruilin Li, Xin Wang, Hongyuan Zha, Molei Tao</h4> Abstract: Common Stochastic Gradient MCMC methods approximate gradients by stochastic ones via uniformly subsampled data points. We propose that a non-uniform subsampling can reduce the variance introduced by the stochastic approximation, hence making the sampling of a target distribution more accurate. An exponentially weighted stochastic gradient approach (EWSG) is developed for this objective by matching the transition kernels of SG-MCMC methods respectively based on stochastic and batch gradients. A demonstration of EWSG combined with second-order Langevin equation for sampling purposes is provided. In our method, non-uniform subsampling is done efficiently via a Metropolis-Hasting chain on the data index, which is coupled to the sampling algorithm. The fact that our method has reduced local variance with high probability is theoretically analyzed. A non-asymptotic global error analysis is also presented. Numerical experiments based on both synthetic and real world data sets are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches. While statistical accuracy has improved, the speed of convergence was empirically observed to be at least comparable to the uniform version. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08949">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Nystr√∂m Subspace Learning for Large-scale SVMs</h3><h4>Weida Li, Mingxia Liu, Daoqiang Zhang</h4> Abstract: As an implementation of the Nystr\"{o}m method, Nystr\"{o}m computational regularization (NCR) imposed on kernel classification and kernel ridge regression has proven capable of achieving optimal bounds in the large-scale statistical learning setting, while enjoying much better time complexity. In this study, we propose a Nystr\"{o}m subspace learning (NSL) framework to reveal that all you need for employing the Nystr\"{o}m method, including NCR, upon any kernel SVM is to use the efficient off-the-shelf linear SVM solvers as a black box. Based on our analysis, the bounds developed for the Nystr\"{o}m method are linked to NSL, and the analytical difference between two distinct implementations of the Nystr\"{o}m method is clearly presented. Besides, NSL also leads to sharper theoretical results for the clustered Nystr\"{o}m method. Finally, both regression and classification tasks are performed to compare two implementations of the Nystr\"{o}m method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08937">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Meta-learning for mixed linear regression</h3><h4>Weihao Kong, Raghav Somani, Zhao Song, Sham Kakade, Sewoong Oh</h4> Abstract: In modern supervised learning, there are a large number of tasks, but many of them are associated with only a small amount of labeled data. These include data from medical image processing and robotic interaction. Even though each individual task cannot be meaningfully trained in isolation, one seeks to meta-learn across the tasks from past experiences by exploiting some similarities. We study a fundamental question of interest: When can abundant tasks with small data compensate for lack of tasks with big data? We focus on a canonical scenario where each task is drawn from a mixture of $k$ linear regressions, and identify sufficient conditions for such a graceful exchange to hold; The total number of examples necessary with only small data tasks scales similarly as when big data tasks are available. To this end, we introduce a novel spectral approach and show that we can efficiently utilize small data tasks with the help of $\tilde\Omega(k^{3/2})$ medium data tasks each with $\tilde\Omega(k^{1/2})$ examples. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08936">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Online high rank matrix completion</h3><h4>Jicong Fan, Madeleine Udell</h4> Abstract: Recent advances in matrix completion enable data imputation in full-rank matrices by exploiting low dimensional (nonlinear) latent structure. In this paper, we develop a new model for high rank matrix completion (HRMC), together with batch and online methods to fit the model and out-of-sample extension to complete new data. The method works by (implicitly) mapping the data into a high dimensional polynomial feature space using the kernel trick; importantly, the data occupies a low dimensional subspace in this feature space, even when the original data matrix is of full-rank. We introduce an explicit parametrization of this low dimensional subspace, and an online fitting procedure, to reduce computational complexity compared to the state of the art. The online method can also handle streaming or sequential data and adapt to non-stationary latent structure. We provide guidance on the sampling rate required these methods to succeed. Experimental results on synthetic data and motion capture data validate the performance of the proposed methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08934">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Multi-step Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>J. H. Moon, Debasmit Das, C. S. George Lee</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OUDA) problem, where the target data are unlabelled and arriving sequentially. The traditional methods on the OUDA problem mainly focus on transforming each arriving target data to the source domain, and they do not sufficiently consider the temporal coherency and accumulative statistics among the arriving target data. We propose a multi-step framework for the OUDA problem, which institutes a novel method to compute the mean-target subspace inspired by the geometrical interpretation on the Euclidean space. This mean-target subspace contains accumulative temporal information among the arrived target data. Moreover, the transformation matrix computed from the mean-target subspace is applied to the next target data as a preprocessing step, aligning the target data closer to the source domain. Experiments on four datasets demonstrated the contribution of each step in our proposed multi-step OUDA framework and its performance over previous approaches. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08930">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Regularized Autoencoders via Relaxed Injective Probability Flow</h3><h4>Abhishek Kumar, Ben Poole, Kevin Murphy</h4> Abstract: Invertible flow-based generative models are an effective method for learning to generate samples, while allowing for tractable likelihood computation and inference. However, the invertibility requirement restricts models to have the same latent dimensionality as the inputs. This imposes significant architectural, memory, and computational costs, making them more challenging to scale than other classes of generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a generative model based on probability flows that does away with the bijectivity requirement on the model and only assumes injectivity. This also provides another perspective on regularized autoencoders (RAEs), with our final objectives resembling RAEs with specific regularizers that are derived by lower bounding the probability flow objective. We empirically demonstrate the promise of the proposed model, improving over VAEs and AEs in terms of sample quality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08927">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Dissipative SymODEN: Encoding Hamiltonian Dynamics with Dissipation and  Control into Deep Learning</h3><h4>Yaofeng Desmond Zhong, Biswadip Dey, Amit Chakraborty</h4> Abstract: In this work, we introduce Dissipative SymODEN, a deep learning architecture which can infer the dynamics of a physical system with dissipation from observed state trajectories. To improve prediction accuracy while reducing network size, Dissipative SymODEN encodes the port-Hamiltonian dynamics with energy dissipation and external input into the design of its computation graph and learns the dynamics in a structured way. The learned model, by revealing key aspects of the system, such as the inertia, dissipation, and potential energy, paves the way for energy-based controllers. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08860">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	A Bayes-Optimal View on Adversarial Examples</h3><h4>Eitan Richardson, Yair Weiss</h4> Abstract: The ability to fool modern CNN classifiers with tiny perturbations of the input has lead to the development of a large number of candidate defenses and often conflicting explanations. In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial examples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct realistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be efficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions so that the optimal classifier is either robust or vulnerable. By training different classifiers on these datasets (for which the "gold standard" optimal classifiers are known), we can disentangle the possible sources of vulnerability and avoid the accuracy-robustness tradeoff that may occur in commonly used datasets. Our results show that even when the optimal classifier is robust, standard CNN training consistently learns a vulnerable classifier. At the same time, for exactly the same training data, RBF SVMs consistently learn a robust classifier. The same trend is observed in experiments with real images. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08859">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	On the Decision Boundaries of Deep Neural Networks: A Tropical Geometry  Perspective</h3><h4>Motasem Alfarra, Adel Bibi, Hasan Hammoud, Mohamed Gaafar, Bernard Ghanem</h4> Abstract: This work tackles the problem of characterizing and understanding the decision boundaries of neural networks with piecewise linear non-linearity activations. We use tropical geometry, a new development in the area of algebraic geometry, to characterize the decision boundaries of a simple neural network of the form (Affine, ReLU, Affine). Our main finding is that the decision boundaries are a subset of a tropical hypersurface, which is intimately related to a polytope formed by the convex hull of two zonotopes. The generators of these zonotopes are functions of the neural network parameters. This geometric characterization provides new perspective to three tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tropical perspective to the lottery ticket hypothesis, where we see the effect of different initializations on the tropical geometric representation of a network's decision boundaries. Moreover, we use this characterization to propose a new set of tropical regularizers, which directly deal with the decision boundaries of a network. We investigate the use of these regularizers in neural network pruning (by removing network parameters that do not contribute to the tropical geometric representation of the decision boundaries) and in generating adversarial input attacks (by producing input perturbations that explicitly perturb the decision boundaries' geometry and ultimately change the network's prediction). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08838">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	No-Regret and Incentive-Compatible Online Learning</h3><h4>Rupert Freeman, David M. Pennock, Chara Podimata, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan</h4> Abstract: We study online learning settings in which experts act strategically to maximize their influence on the learning algorithm's predictions by potentially misreporting their beliefs about a sequence of binary events. Our goal is twofold. First, we want the learning algorithm to be no-regret with respect to the best fixed expert in hindsight. Second, we want incentive compatibility, a guarantee that each expert's best strategy is to report his true beliefs about the realization of each event. To achieve this goal, we build on the literature on wagering mechanisms, a type of multi-agent scoring rule. We provide algorithms that achieve no regret and incentive compatibility for myopic experts for both the full and partial information settings. In experiments on datasets from FiveThirtyEight, our algorithms have regret comparable to classic no-regret algorithms, which are not incentive-compatible. Finally, we identify an incentive-compatible algorithm for forward-looking strategic agents that exhibits diminishing regret in practice. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08837">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Differential Dynamic Programming Neural Optimizer</h3><h4>Guan-Horng Liu, Tianrong Chen, Evangelos A. Theodorou</h4> Abstract: Interpretation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training as an optimal control problem with nonlinear dynamical systems has received considerable attention recently, yet the algorithmic development remains relatively limited. In this work, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training procedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most widely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order trajectory optimization algorithm rooted in the Approximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new variant of DDP that can accept batch optimization for training feedforward networks, while integrating naturally with the recent progress in curvature approximation. The resulting algorithm features layer-wise feedback policies which improve convergence rate and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing methods. We show that the algorithm is competitive against state-ofthe-art first and second order methods. Our work opens up new avenues for principled algorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08809">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Support-weighted Adversarial Imitation Learning</h3><h4>Ruohan Wang, Carlo Ciliberto, Pierluigi Amadori, Yiannis Demiris</h4> Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a broad family of imitation learning methods designed to mimic expert behaviors from demonstrations. While AIL has shown state-of-the-art performance on imitation learning with only small number of demonstrations, it faces several practical challenges such as potential training instability and implicit reward bias. To address the challenges, we propose Support-weighted Adversarial Imitation Learning (SAIL), a general framework that extends a given AIL algorithm with information derived from support estimation of the expert policies. SAIL improves the quality of the reinforcement signals by weighing the adversarial reward with a confidence score from support estimation of the expert policy. We also show that SAIL is always at least as efficient as the underlying AIL algorithm that SAIL uses for learning the adversarial reward. Empirically, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance and training stability than baseline methods on a wide range of benchmark control tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08803">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	A Structured Prediction Approach for Conditional Meta-Learning</h3><h4>Ruohan Wang, Yiannis Demiris, Carlo Ciliberto</h4> Abstract: Optimization-based meta-learning algorithms are a powerful class of methods for learning-to-learn applications such as few-shot learning. They tackle the limited availability of training data by leveraging the experience gained from previously observed tasks. However, when the complexity of the tasks distribution cannot be captured by a single set of shared meta-parameters, existing methods may fail to fully adapt to a target task. We address this issue with a novel perspective on conditional meta-learning based on structured prediction. We propose task-adaptive structured meta-learning (TASML), a principled estimator that weighs meta-training data conditioned on the target task to design tailored meta-learning objectives. In addition, we introduce algorithmic improvements to tackle key computational limitations of existing methods. Experimentally, we show that TASML outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. An ablation study quantifies the individual contribution of model components and suggests useful practices for meta-learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08799">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	How To Avoid Being Eaten By a Grue: Exploration Strategies for  Text-Adventure Agents</h3><h4>Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Ethan Tien, Zhaochen Luo, Mark O. Riedl</h4> Abstract: Text-based games -- in which an agent interacts with the world through textual natural language -- present us with the problem of combinatorially-sized action-spaces. Most current reinforcement learning algorithms are not capable of effectively handling such a large number of possible actions per turn. Poor sample efficiency, consequently, results in agents that are unable to pass bottleneck states, where they are unable to proceed because they do not see the right action sequence to pass the bottleneck enough times to be sufficiently reinforced. Building on prior work using knowledge graphs in reinforcement learning, we introduce two new game state exploration strategies. We compare our exploration strategies against strong baselines on the classic text-adventure game, Zork1, where prior agent have been unable to get past a bottleneck where the agent is eaten by a Grue. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08795">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization</h3><h4>Andrew Gordon Wilson, Pavel Izmailov</h4> Abstract: The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization, rather than using a single setting of weights. Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without significant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to fit images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. Finally, we provide a Bayesian perspective on tempering for calibrating predictive distributions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08791">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Dynamic Federated Learning</h3><h4>Elsa Rizk, Stefan Vlaski, Ali H. Sayed</h4> Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an umbrella term for centralized coordination strategies in multi-agent environments. While many federated learning architectures process data in an online manner, and are hence adaptive by nature, most performance analyses assume static optimization problems and offer no guarantees in the presence of drifts in the problem solution or data characteristics. We consider a federated learning model where at every iteration, a random subset of available agents perform local updates based on their data. Under a non-stationary random walk model on the true minimizer for the aggregate optimization problem, we establish that the performance of the architecture is determined by three factors, namely, the data variability at each agent, the model variability across all agents, and a tracking term that is inversely proportional to the learning rate of the algorithm. The results clarify the trade-off between convergence and tracking performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08782">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Set2Graph: Learning Graphs From Sets</h3><h4>Hadar Serviansky, Nimrod Segol, Jonathan Shlomi, Kyle Cranmer, Eilam Gross, Haggai Maron, Yaron Lipman</h4> Abstract: Many problems in machine learning (ML) can be cast as learning functions from sets to graphs, or more generally to hypergraphs; in short, Set2Graph functions. Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning triplet data in a collection. Current neural network models that approximate Set2Graph functions come from two main ML sub-fields: equivariant learning, and similarity learning. Equivariant models would be in general computationally challenging or even infeasible, while similarity learning models can be shown to have limited expressive power. In this paper we suggest a neural network model family for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets. Testing our models on different machine learning tasks, including an application to particle physics, we find them favorable to existing baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08772">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 18	Error detection in Knowledge Graphs: Path Ranking, Embeddings or both?</h3><h4>R. Fasoulis, K. Bougiatiotis, F. Aisopos, A. Nentidis, G. Paliouras</h4> Abstract: This paper attempts to compare and combine different approaches for de-tecting errors in Knowledge Graphs. Knowledge Graphs constitute a mainstreamapproach for the representation of relational information on big heterogeneous data,however, they may contain a big amount of imputed noise when constructed auto-matically. To address this problem, different error detection methodologies have beenproposed, mainly focusing on path ranking and representation learning. This workpresents various mainstream approaches and proposes a novel hybrid and modularmethodology for the task. We compare these methods on two benchmarks and one real-world biomedical publications dataset, showcasing the potential of our approach anddrawing insights regarding the state-of-art in error detection in Knowledge Graphs <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08762">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	Towards Certifiable Adversarial Sample Detection</h3><h4>Ilia Shumailov, Yiren Zhao, Robert Mullins, Ross Anderson</h4> Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deployed in more and more classification systems, but adversarial samples can be maliciously crafted to trick them, and are becoming a real threat. There have been various proposals to improve CNNs' adversarial robustness but these all suffer performance penalties or other limitations. In this paper, we provide a new approach in the form of a certifiable adversarial detection scheme, the Certifiable Taboo Trap (CTT). The system can provide certifiable guarantees of detection of adversarial inputs for certain $l_{\infty}$ sizes on a reasonable assumption, namely that the training data have the same distribution as the test data. We develop and evaluate several versions of CTT with a range of defense capabilities, training overheads and certifiability on adversarial samples. Against adversaries with various $l_p$ norms, CTT outperforms existing defense methods that focus purely on improving network robustness. We show that CTT has small false positive rates on clean test data, minimal compute overheads when deployed, and can support complex security policies. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08740">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Bimodal Distribution Removal and Genetic Algorithm in Neural Network for  Breast Cancer Diagnosis</h3><h4>Ke Quan</h4> Abstract: Diagnosis of breast cancer has been well studied in the past. Multiple linear programming models have been devised to approximate the relationship between cell features and tumour malignancy. However, these models are less capable in handling non-linear correlations. Neural networks instead are powerful in processing complex non-linear correlations. It is thus certainly beneficial to approach this cancer diagnosis problem with a model based on neural network. Particularly, introducing bias to neural network training process is deemed as an important means to increase training efficiency. Out of a number of popular proposed methods for introducing artificial bias, Bimodal Distribution Removal (BDR) presents ideal efficiency improvement results and fair simplicity in implementation. However, this paper examines the effectiveness of BDR against the target cancer diagnosis classification problem and shows that BDR process in fact negatively impacts classification performance. In addition, this paper also explores genetic algorithm as an efficient tool for feature selection and produced significantly better results comparing to baseline model that without any feature selection in place <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08729">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Do We Need Zero Training Loss After Achieving Zero Training Error?</h3><h4>Takashi Ishida, Ikko Yamane, Tomoya Sakai, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama</h4> Abstract: Overparameterized deep networks have the capacity to memorize training data with zero training error. Even after memorization, the training loss continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, they often fail to maintain a moderate level of training loss, ending up with a too small or too large loss. We propose a direct solution called flooding that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the flooding level. Our approach makes the loss float around the flooding level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flooding level. This can be implemented with one line of code, and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers. With flooding, the model will continue to "random walk" with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization. We experimentally show that flooding improves performance and as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08709">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	Performance Aware Convolutional Neural Network Channel Pruning for  Embedded GPUs</h3><h4>Valentin Radu, Kuba Kaszyk, Yuan Wen, Jack Turner, Jose Cano, Elliot J. Crowley, Bjorn Franke, Amos Storkey, Michael O'Boyle</h4> Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are becoming a common presence in many applications and services, due to their superior recognition accuracy. They are increasingly being used on mobile devices, many times just by porting large models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes, making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer, based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2x slowdown. On the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves the intended results, with performance speedups of 3x with cuDNN and above 10x with Arm Compute Library and TVM. Our findings expose the need for hardware-instructed neural network pruning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08697">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Stochastic Optimization for Regularized Wasserstein Estimators</h3><h4>Marin Ballu, Quentin Berthet, Francis Bach</h4> Abstract: Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects. Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down first-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08695">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Unsupervised Multi-Class Domain Adaptation: Theory, Algorithms, and  Practice</h3><h4>Yabin Zhang, Bin Deng, Hui Tang, Lei Zhang, Kui Jia</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we study the formalism of unsupervised multi-class domain adaptation (multi-class UDA), which underlies some recent algorithms whose learning objectives are only motivated empirically. A Multi-Class Scoring Disagreement (MCSD) divergence is presented by aggregating the absolute margin violations in multi-class classification; the proposed MCSD is able to fully characterize the relations between any pair of multi-class scoring hypotheses. By using MCSD as a measure of domain distance, we develop a new domain adaptation bound for multi-class UDA as well as its data-dependent, probably approximately correct bound, which naturally suggest adversarial learning objectives to align conditional feature distributions across the source and target domains. Consequently, an algorithmic framework of Multi-class Domain-adversarial learning Networks (McDalNets) is developed, whose different instantiations via surrogate learning objectives either coincide with or resemble a few of recently popular methods, thus (partially) underscoring their practical effectiveness. Based on our same theory of multi-class UDA, we also introduce a new algorithm of Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymmNets), which is featured by a novel adversarial strategy of domain confusion and discrimination. SymmNets afford simple extensions that work equally well under the problem settings of either closed set, partial, or open set UDA. We conduct careful empirical studies to compare different algorithms of McDalNets and our newly introduced SymmNets. Experiments verify our theoretical analysis and show the efficacy of our proposed SymmNets. We make our implementation codes publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08681">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Learning with Differentiable Perturbed Optimizers</h3><h4>Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel, Olivier Teboul, Marco Cuturi, Jean-Philippe Vert, Francis Bach</h4> Abstract: Machine learning pipelines often rely on optimization procedures to make discrete decisions (e.g. sorting, picking closest neighbors, finding shortest paths or optimal matchings). Although these discrete decisions are easily computed in a forward manner, they cannot be used to modify model parameters using first-order optimization techniques because they break the back-propagation of computational graphs. In order to expand the scope of learning problems that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a systematic method to transform a block that outputs an optimal discrete decision into a differentiable operation. Our approach relies on stochastic perturbations of these parameters, and can be used readily within existing solvers without the need for ad hoc regularization or smoothing. These perturbed optimizers yield solutions that are differentiable and never locally constant. The amount of smoothness can be tuned via the chosen noise amplitude, whose impact we analyze. The derivatives of these perturbed solvers can be evaluated efficiently. We also show how this framework can be connected to a family of losses developed in structured prediction, and describe how these can be used in unsupervised and supervised learning, with theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on several machine learning tasks in experiments on synthetic and real data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08676">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Discriminative Manifold Embedding and  Alignment</h3><h4>You-Wei Luo, Chuan-Xian Ren, Pengfei Ge, Ke-Kun Huang, Yu-Feng Yu</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation is effective in leveraging the rich information from the source domain to the unsupervised target domain. Though deep learning and adversarial strategy make an important breakthrough in the adaptability of features, there are two issues to be further explored. First, the hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are risky to the intrinsic data structure. Second, the batch-wise training manner in deep learning limits the description of the global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold learning framework is proposed to achieve transferability and discriminability consistently. As to the first problem, this method establishes a probabilistic discriminant criterion on the target domain via soft labels. Further, this criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second issue; such approximation is also memory-saving. The manifold metric alignment is exploited to be compatible with the embedding space. A theoretical error bound is derived to facilitate the alignment. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the proposal and results of the comparison study manifest the superiority of consistent manifold learning framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08675">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Computationally Tractable Riemannian Manifolds for Graph Embeddings</h3><h4>Calin Cruceru, Gary B√©cigneul, Octavian-Eugen Ganea</h4> Abstract: Representing graphs as sets of node embeddings in certain curved Riemannian manifolds has recently gained momentum in machine learning due to their desirable geometric inductive biases, e.g., hierarchical structures benefit from hyperbolic geometry. However, going beyond embedding spaces of constant sectional curvature, while potentially more representationally powerful, proves to be challenging as one can easily lose the appeal of computationally tractable tools such as geodesic distances or Riemannian gradients. Here, we explore computationally efficient matrix manifolds, showcasing how to learn and optimize graph embeddings in these Riemannian spaces. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over Euclidean geometry while often outperforming hyperbolic and elliptical embeddings based on various metrics that capture different graph properties. Our results serve as new evidence for the benefits of non-Euclidean embeddings in machine learning pipelines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08665">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Adaptive Graph Auto-Encoder for General Data Clustering</h3><h4>Xuelong Li, Hongyuan Zhang, Rui Zhang</h4> Abstract: Graph based clustering plays an important role in clustering area. Recent studies about graph convolution neural networks have achieved impressive success on graph type data. However, in traditional clustering tasks, the graph structure of data does not exist such that the strategy to construct graph is crucial for performance. In addition, the existing graph auto-encoder based approaches perform poorly on weighted graph, which is widely used in graph based clustering. In this paper, we propose a graph auto-encoder with local structure preserving for general data clustering, which can update the constructed graph adaptively. The adaptive process is designed to utilize the non-Euclidean structure sufficiently. By combining generative model for graph embedding and graph based clustering, a graph auto-encoder with a novel decoder is developed and it performs well in weighted graph used scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08648">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Uncovering Coresets for Classification With Multi-Objective Evolutionary  Algorithms</h3><h4>Pietro Barbiero, Giovanni Squillero, Alberto Tonda</h4> Abstract: A coreset is a subset of the training set, using which a machine learning algorithm obtains performances similar to what it would deliver if trained over the whole original data. Coreset discovery is an active and open line of research as it allows improving training speed for the algorithms and may help human understanding the results. Building on previous works, a novel approach is presented: candidate corsets are iteratively optimized, adding and removing samples. As there is an obvious trade-off between limiting training size and quality of the results, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to minimize simultaneously the number of points in the set and the classification error. Experimental results on non-trivial benchmarks show that the proposed approach is able to deliver results that allow a classifier to obtain lower error and better ability of generalizing on unseen data than state-of-the-art coreset discovery techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08645">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder with Joint Clustering via Adjacency Sharing</h3><h4>Xuelong Li, Hongyuan Zhang, Rui Zhang</h4> Abstract: Graph convolution networks have attracted many attentions and several graph auto-encoder based clustering models are developed for attributed graph clustering. However, most existing approaches separate clustering and optimization of graph auto-encoder into two individual steps. In this paper, we propose a graph convolution network based clustering model, namely, Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder with JOint Clustering via Adjacency Sharing (\textit{EGAE-JOCAS}). As for the embedded model, we develop a novel joint clustering method, which combines relaxed k-means and spectral clustering and is applicable for the learned embedding. The proposed joint clustering shares the same adjacency within graph convolution layers. Two parts are optimized simultaneously through performing SGD and taking close-form solutions alternatively to ensure a rapid convergence. Moreover, our model is free to incorporate any mechanisms (e.g., attention) into graph auto-encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of EGAE-JOCAS. Sufficient theoretical analyses are provided to support the results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08643">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	A Novel Framework for Selection of GANs for an Application</h3><h4>Tanya Motwani, Manojkumar Parmar</h4> Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a current focal point of research. The body of knowledge is fragmented, leading to a trial-error method while selecting an appropriate GAN for a given scenario. We provide a comprehensive summary of the evolution of GANs starting from its inception addressing issues like mode collapse, vanishing gradient, unstable training and non-convergence. We also provide a comparison of various GANs from the application point of view, its behaviour and implementation details. We propose a novel framework to identify candidate GANs for a specific use case based on architecture, loss, regularization and divergence. We also discuss application of the framework using an example, and we demonstrate a significant reduction in search space. This efficient way to determine potential GANs lowers unit economics of AI development for organizations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08641">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	The Benefits of Pairwise Discriminators for Adversarial Training</h3><h4>Shangyuan Tong, Timur Garipov, Tommi Jaakkola</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training methods typically align distributions by solving two-player games. However, in most current formulations, even if the generator aligns perfectly with data, a sub-optimal discriminator can still drive the two apart. Absent additional regularization, the instability can manifest itself as a never-ending game. In this paper, we introduce a family of objectives by leveraging pairwise discriminators, and show that only the generator needs to converge. The alignment, if achieved, would be preserved with any discriminator. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence; characterize the capacity balance that should guide the discriminator and generator choices; and construct examples of minimally sufficient discriminators. Empirically, we illustrate the theory and the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic examples. Moreover, we show that practical methods derived from our approach can better generate higher-resolution images. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08621">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Boosting Adversarial Training with Hypersphere Embedding</h3><h4>Tianyu Pang, Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Kun Xu, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective defenses to improve the adversarial robustness of deep learning models. In order to promote the reliability of the adversarially trained models, we propose to boost AT via incorporating hypersphere embedding (HE), which can regularize the adversarial features onto compact hypersphere manifolds. We formally demonstrate that AT and HE are well coupled, which tunes up the learning dynamics of AT from several aspects. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness and universality of HE by embedding it into the popular AT frameworks including PGD-AT, ALP, and TRADES, as well as the FreeAT and FastAT strategies. In experiments, we evaluate our methods on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and verify that integrating HE can consistently enhance the performance of the models trained by each AT framework with little extra computation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08619">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Diversity sampling is an implicit regularization for kernel methods</h3><h4>Micha√´l Fanuel, Joachim Schreurs, Johan A.K. Suykens</h4> Abstract: Kernel methods have achieved very good performance on large scale regression and classification problems, by using the Nystr\"om method and preconditioning techniques. The Nystr\"om approximation -- based on a subset of landmarks -- gives a low rank approximation of the kernel matrix, and is known to provide a form of implicit regularization. We further elaborate on the impact of sampling diverse landmarks for constructing the Nystr\"om approximation in supervised as well as unsupervised kernel methods. By using Determinantal Point Processes for sampling, we obtain additional theoretical results concerning the interplay between diversity and regularization. Empirically, we demonstrate the advantages of training kernel methods based on subsets made of diverse points. In particular, if the dataset has a dense bulk and a sparser tail, we show that Nystr\"om kernel regression with diverse landmarks increases the accuracy of the regression in sparser regions of the dataset, with respect to a uniform landmark sampling. A greedy heuristic is also proposed to select diverse samples of significant size within large datasets when exact DPP sampling is not practically feasible. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08616">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Optimizing Black-box Metrics with Adaptive Surrogates</h3><h4>Qijia Jiang, Olaoluwa Adigun, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Mahdi Milani Fard, Maya Gupta</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of training models with black-box and hard-to-optimize metrics by expressing the metric as a monotonic function of a small number of easy-to-optimize surrogates. We pose the training problem as an optimization over a relaxed surrogate space, which we solve by estimating local gradients for the metric and performing inexact convex projections. We analyze gradient estimates based on finite differences and local linear interpolations, and show convergence of our approach under smoothness assumptions with respect to the surrogates. Experimental results on classification and ranking problems verify the proposal performs on par with methods that know the mathematical formulation, and adds notable value when the form of the metric is unknown. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08605">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements</h3><h4>Haggai Maron, Or Litany, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya</h4> Abstract: Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, which is attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to certain symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08599">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	Interpretability of machine learning based prediction models in  healthcare</h3><h4>Gregor Stiglic, Primoz Kocbek, Nino Fijacko, Marinka Zitnik, Katrien Verbert, Leona Cilar</h4> Abstract: There is a need of ensuring machine learning models that are interpretable. Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08596">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	Regret Minimization in Stochastic Contextual Dueling Bandits</h3><h4>Aadirupa Saha, Aditya Gopalan</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of stochastic $K$-armed dueling bandit in the contextual setting, where at each round the learner is presented with a context set of $K$ items, each represented by a $d$-dimensional feature vector, and the goal of the learner is to identify the best arm of each context sets. However, unlike the classical contextual bandit setup, our framework only allows the learner to receive item feedback in terms of their (noisy) pariwise preferences--famously studied as dueling bandits which is practical interests in various online decision making scenarios, e.g. recommender systems, information retrieval, tournament ranking, where it is easier to elicit the relative strength of the items instead of their absolute scores. However, to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to consider the problem of regret minimization of contextual dueling bandits for potentially infinite decision spaces and gives provably optimal algorithms along with a matching lower bound analysis. We present two algorithms for the setup with respective regret guarantees $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT \log K})$. Subsequently we also show that $\Omega(\sqrt {dT})$ is actually the fundamental performance limit for this problem, implying the optimality of our second algorithm. However the analysis of our first algorithm is comparatively simpler, and it is often shown to outperform the former empirically. Finally, we corroborate all the theoretical results with suitable experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08583">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Differentially Private ERM Based on Data Perturbation</h3><h4>Yilin Kang, Yong Liu, Lizhong Ding, Xinwang Liu, Xinyi Tong, Weiping Wang</h4> Abstract: In this paper, after observing that different training data instances affect the machine learning model to different extents, we attempt to improve the performance of differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM) from a new perspective. Specifically, we measure the contributions of various training data instances on the final machine learning model, and select some of them to add random noise. Considering that the key of our method is to measure each data instance separately, we propose a new `Data perturbation' based (DB) paradigm for DP-ERM: adding random noise to the original training data and achieving ($\epsilon,\delta$)-differential privacy on the final machine learning model, along with the preservation on the original data. By introducing the Influence Function (IF), we quantitatively measure the impact of the training data on the final model. Theoretical and experimental results show that our proposed DBDP-ERM paradigm enhances the model performance significantly. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08578">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Input Perturbation: A New Paradigm between Central and Local  Differential Privacy</h3><h4>Yilin Kang, Yong Liu, Ben Niu, Xinyi Tong, Likun Zhang, Weiping Wang</h4> Abstract: Traditionally, there are two models on differential privacy: the central model and the local model. The central model focuses on the machine learning model and the local model focuses on the training data. In this paper, we study the \textit{input perturbation} method in differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM), preserving privacy of the central model. By adding noise to the original training data and training with the `perturbed data', we achieve ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differential privacy on the final model, along with some kind of privacy on the original data. We observe that there is an interesting connection between the local model and the central model: the perturbation on the original data causes the perturbation on the gradient, and finally the model parameters. This observation means that our method builds a bridge between local and central model, protecting the data, the gradient and the model simultaneously, which is more superior than previous central methods. Detailed theoretical analysis and experiments show that our method achieves almost the same (or even better) performance as some of the best previous central methods with more protections on privacy, which is an attractive result. Moreover, we extend our method to a more general case: the loss function satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is more general than strong convexity, the constraint on the loss function in most previous work. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08570">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	Towards Byzantine-resilient Learning in Decentralized Systems</h3><h4>Shangwei Guo, Tianwei Zhang, Xiaofei Xie, Lei Ma, Tao Xiang, Yang Liu</h4> Abstract: With the proliferation of IoT and edge computing, decentralized learning is becoming more promising. When designing a distributed learning system, one major challenge to consider is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). Past works have researched Byzantine-resilient solutions for centralized distributed learning. However, there are currently no satisfactory solutions with strong efficiency and security in decentralized systems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Mozi, to achieve BFT in decentralized learning systems. Specifically, Mozi provides a uniform Byzantine-resilient aggregation rule for benign nodes to select the useful parameter updates and filter out the malicious ones in each training iteration. It guarantees that each benign node in a decentralized system can train a correct model under very strong Byzantine attacks with an arbitrary number of faulty nodes. We perform the theoretical analysis to prove the uniform convergence of our proposed algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the high security and efficiency of Mozi compared to all existing solutions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08569">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Self-Powered and Sustainable  Edge Computing Systems</h3><h4>Md. Shirajum Munir, Nguyen H. Tran, Walid Saad, Choong Seon Hong</h4> Abstract: The stringent requirements of mobile edge computing (MEC) applications and functions fathom the high capacity and dense deployment of MEC hosts to the upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a BS unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this paper, an effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic, asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the energy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08567">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	Non-asymptotic and Accurate Learning of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</h3><h4>Yahya Sattar, Samet Oymak</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stabilizable systems governed by nonlinear state equation $h_{t+1}=\phi(h_t,u_t;\theta)+w_t$. Here $\theta$ is the unknown system dynamics, $h_t $ is the state, $u_t$ is the input and $w_t$ is the additive noise vector. We study gradient based algorithms to learn the system dynamics $\theta$ from samples obtained from a single finite trajectory. If the system is run by a stabilizing input policy, we show that temporally-dependent samples can be approximated by i.i.d. samples via a truncation argument by using mixing-time arguments. We then develop new guarantees for the uniform convergence of the gradients of empirical loss. Unlike existing work, our bounds are noise sensitive which allows for learning ground-truth dynamics with high accuracy and small sample complexity. Together, our results facilitate efficient learning of the general nonlinear system under stabilizing policy. We specialize our guarantees to entry-wise nonlinear activations and verify our theory in various numerical experiments <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Safe Counterfactual Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Yusuke Narita, Shota Yasui, Kohei Yata</h4> Abstract: We develop a method for predicting the performance of reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms, given historical data that may have been generated by a different algorithm. Our estimator has the property that its prediction converges in probability to the true performance of a counterfactual algorithm at the fast $\sqrt{N}$ rate, as the sample size $N$ increases. We also show a correct way to estimate the variance of our prediction, thus allowing the analyst to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. These properties hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of potentially important state variables are really important. These theoretical guarantees make our estimator safe to use. We finally apply it to improve advertisement design by a major advertisement company. We find that our method produces smaller mean squared errors than state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08536">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Adaptive Sampling Distributed Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient for  Heterogeneous Distributed Datasets</h3><h4>Ilqar Ramazanli, Han Nguyen, Hai Pham, Sashank Reddi, Barnabas Poczos</h4> Abstract: We study distributed optimization algorithms for minimizing the average of \emph{heterogeneous} functions distributed across several machines with a focus on communication efficiency. In such settings, naively using the classical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants (e.g., SVRG) with a uniform sampling of machines typically yields poor performance. It often leads to the dependence of convergence rate on maximum Lipschitz constant of gradients across the devices. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{adaptive} sampling of machines specially catered to these settings. Our method relies on an adaptive estimate of local Lipschitz constants base on the information of past gradients. We show that the new way improves the dependence of convergence rate from maximum Lipschitz constant to \emph{average} Lipschitz constant across machines, thereby, significantly accelerating the convergence. Our experiments demonstrate that our method indeed speeds up the convergence of the standard SVRG algorithm in heterogeneous environments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08528">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	NAttack! Adversarial Attacks to bypass a GAN based classifier trained to  detect Network intrusion</h3><h4>Aritran Piplai, Sai Sree Laya Chukkapalli, Anupam Joshi</h4> Abstract: With the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, anomalies in network traffic can be detected using machine learning approaches. Before the rise of machine learning, network anomalies which could imply an attack, were detected using well-crafted rules. An attacker who has knowledge in the field of cyber-defence could make educated guesses to sometimes accurately predict which particular features of network traffic data the cyber-defence mechanism is looking at. With this information, the attacker can circumvent a rule-based cyber-defense system. However, after the advancements of machine learning for network anomaly, it is not easy for a human to understand how to bypass a cyber-defence system. Recently, adversarial attacks have become increasingly common to defeat machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we show that even if we build a classifier and train it with adversarial examples for network data, we can use adversarial attacks and successfully break the system. We propose a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)based algorithm to generate data to train an efficient neural network based classifier, and we subsequently break the system using adversarial attacks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08527">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization</h3><h4>David Eriksson, Matthias Poloczek</h4> Abstract: The global optimization of a high-dimensional black-box function under black-box constraints is a pervasive task in machine learning, control, and engineering. These problems are difficult since the feasible set is typically non-convex and hard to find, in addition to the curses of dimensionality and the heterogeneity of the underlying functions. In particular, these characteristics dramatically impact the performance of Bayesian optimization methods, that otherwise have become the de-facto standard for sample-efficient optimization in unconstrained settings. Due to the lack of sample-efficient methods, practitioners usually fall back to evolutionary strategies or heuristics. We propose the scalable constrained Bayesian optimization (SCBO) algorithm that addresses the above challenges by data-independent transformations of the functions and follows the recent theme of local Bayesian optimization. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SCBO achieves excellent results and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08526">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	Avoiding Kernel Fixed Points: Computing with ELU and GELU Infinite  Networks</h3><h4>Russell Tsuchida, Tim Pearce, Christopher Van Der Heide, Fred Roosta, Marcus Gallagher</h4> Abstract: Analysing and computing with Gaussian processes arising from infinitely wide neural networks has recently seen a resurgence in popularity. Despite this, many explicit covariance functions of networks with activation functions used in modern networks remain unknown. Furthermore, while the kernels of deep networks can be computed iteratively, theoretical understanding of deep kernels is lacking, particularly with respect to fixed-point dynamics. Firstly, we derive the covariance functions of MLPs with exponential linear units and Gaussian error linear units and evaluate the performance of the limiting Gaussian processes on some benchmarks. Secondly, and more generally, we introduce a framework for analysing the fixed-point dynamics of iterated kernels corresponding to a broad range of activation functions. We find that unlike some previously studied neural network kernels, these new kernels exhibit non-trivial fixed-point dynamics which are mirrored in finite-width neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08517">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 49	Estimating Training Data Influence by Tracking Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Garima Pruthi, Frederick Liu, Mukund Sundararajan, Satyen Kale</h4> Abstract: We introduce a method called TrackIn that computes the influence of a training example on a prediction made by the model, by tracking how the loss on the test point changes during the training process whenever the training example of interest was utilized. We provide a scalable implementation of TrackIn via a combination of a few key ideas: (a) a first-order approximation to the exact computation, (b) using random projections to speed up the computation of the first-order approximation for large models, (c) using saved checkpoints of standard training procedures, and (d) cherry-picking layers of a deep neural network. An experimental evaluation shows that TrackIn is more effective in identifying mislabelled training examples than other related methods such as influence functions and representer points. We also discuss insights from applying the method on vision, regression and natural language tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08484">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 50	Strength from Weakness: Fast Learning Using Weak Supervision</h3><h4>Joshua Robinson, Stefanie Jegelka, Suvrit Sra</h4> Abstract: We study generalization properties of weakly supervised learning. That is, learning where only a few "strong" labels (the actual target of our prediction) are present but many more "weak" labels are available. In particular, we show that having access to weak labels can significantly accelerate the learning rate for the strong task to the fast rate of $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac1n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of strongly labeled data points. This acceleration can happen even if by itself the strongly labeled data admits only the slower $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ rate. The actual acceleration depends continuously on the number of weak labels available, and on the relation between the two tasks. Our theoretical results are reflected empirically across a range of tasks and illustrate how weak labels speed up learning on the strong task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08483">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 51	AdvMS: A Multi-source Multi-cost Defense Against Adversarial Attacks</h3><h4>Xiao Wang, Siyue Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xue Lin, Peter Chin</h4> Abstract: Designing effective defense against adversarial attacks is a crucial topic as deep neural networks have been proliferated rapidly in many security-critical domains such as malware detection and self-driving cars. Conventional defense methods, although shown to be promising, are largely limited by their single-source single-cost nature: The robustness promotion tends to plateau when the defenses are made increasingly stronger while the cost tends to amplify. In this paper, we study principles of designing multi-source and multi-cost schemes where defense performance is boosted from multiple defending components. Based on this motivation, we propose a multi-source and multi-cost defense scheme, Adversarially Trained Model Switching (AdvMS), that inherits advantages from two leading schemes: adversarial training and random model switching. We show that the multi-source nature of AdvMS mitigates the performance plateauing issue and the multi-cost nature enables improving robustness at a flexible and adjustable combination of costs over different factors which can better suit specific restrictions and needs in practice. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08439">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 52	PrivacyFL: A simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated  learning</h3><h4>Vaikkunth Mugunthan, Anton Peraire-Bueno, Lalana Kagal</h4> Abstract: Federated learning is a technique that enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model while keeping their training data localized. This reduces data privacy risks, however, privacy concerns still exist since it is possible to leak information about the training dataset from the trained model's weights or parameters. Setting up a federated learning environment, especially with security and privacy guarantees, is a time-consuming process with numerous configurations and parameters that can be manipulated. In order to help clients ensure that collaboration is feasible and to check that it improves their model accuracy, a real-world simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated learning is required. In this paper, we introduce PrivacyFL, which is an extensible, easily configurable and scalable simulator for federated learning environments. Its key features include latency simulation, robustness to client departure, support for both centralized and decentralized learning, and configurable privacy and security mechanisms based on differential privacy and secure multiparty computation. In this paper, we motivate our research, describe the architecture of the simulator and associated protocols, and discuss its evaluation in numerous scenarios that highlight its wide range of functionality and its advantages. Our paper addresses a significant real-world problem: checking the feasibility of participating in a federated learning environment under a variety of circumstances. It also has a strong practical impact because organizations such as hospitals, banks, and research institutes, which have large amounts of sensitive data and would like to collaborate, would greatly benefit from having a system that enables them to do so in a privacy-preserving and secure manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08423">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 53	Warm Starting Bandits with Side Information from Confounded Data</h3><h4>Nihal Sharma, Soumya Basu, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Sanjay Shakkottai</h4> Abstract: We study a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem where side information in the form of bounds on the mean of each arm is provided. We describe how these bounds on the means can be used efficiently for warm starting bandits. Specifically, we propose the novel UCB-SI algorithm, and illustrate improvements in cumulative regret over the standard UCB algorithm, both theoretically and empirically, in the presence of non-trivial side information. As noted in (Zhang & Bareinboim, 2017), such information arises, for instance, when we have prior logged data on the arms, but this data has been collected under a policy whose choice of arms is based on latent variables to which access is no longer available. We further provide a novel approach for obtaining such bounds from prior partially confounded data under some mild assumptions. We validate our findings through semi-synthetic experiments on data derived from real datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08405">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 54	Keep Doing What Worked: Behavioral Modelling Priors for Offline  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Noah Y. Siegel, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Felix Berkenkamp, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Michael Neunert, Thomas Lampe, Roland Hafner, Martin Riedmiller</h4> Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -- the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -- to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources. We find improvements on competitive baselines in a variety of RL tasks -- including standard continuous control benchmarks and multi-task learning for simulated and real-world robots. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08396">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 55	Predicting Many Properties of a Quantum System from Very Few  Measurements</h3><h4>Hsin-Yuan Huang, Richard Kueng, John Preskill</h4> Abstract: Predicting properties of complex, large-scale quantum systems is essential for developing quantum technologies. We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a classical shadow, can be used to predict many different properties: order $\log M$ measurements suffice to accurately predict $M$ different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size, and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables, and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians, which allows applications to speedup variational quantum algorithms. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08953">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 56	I-SPEC: An End-to-End Framework for Learning Transportable, Shift-Stable  Models</h3><h4>Adarsh Subbaswamy, Suchi Saria</h4> Abstract: Shifts in environment between development and deployment cause classical supervised learning to produce models that fail to generalize well to new target distributions. Recently, many solutions which find invariant predictive distributions have been developed. Among these, graph-based approaches do not require data from the target environment and can capture more stable information than alternative methods which find stable feature sets. However, these approaches assume that the data generating process is known in the form of a full causal graph, which is generally not the case. In this paper, we propose I-SPEC, an end-to-end framework that addresses this shortcoming by using data to learn a partial ancestral graph (PAG). Using the PAG we develop an algorithm that determines an interventional distribution that is stable to the declared shifts; this subsumes existing approaches which find stable feature sets that are less accurate. We apply I-SPEC to a mortality prediction problem to show it can learn a model that is robust to shifts without needing upfront knowledge of the full causal DAG. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08948">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 57	Implicit differentiation of Lasso-type models for hyperparameter  optimization</h3><h4>Quentin Bertrand, Quentin Klopfenstein, Mathieu Blondel, Samuel Vaiter, Alexandre Gramfort, Joseph Salmon</h4> Abstract: Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously difficult, though crucial in practice. The most popular hyperparameter optimization approach is grid-search using held-out validation data. Grid-search however requires to choose a predefined grid for each parameter, which scales exponentially in the number of parameters. Another approach is to cast hyperparameter optimization as a bi-level optimization problem, one can solve by gradient descent. The key challenge for these methods is the estimation of the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. Computing this gradient via forward or backward automatic differentiation is possible yet usually suffers from high memory consumption. Alternatively implicit differentiation typically involves solving a linear system which can be prohibitive and numerically unstable in high dimension. In addition, implicit differentiation usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the case for Lasso-type problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation algorithm, without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our approach scales to high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods to optimize the error on held-out data, or the Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08943">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 58	Wavesplit: End-to-End Speech Separation by Speaker Clustering</h3><h4>Neil Zeghidour, David Grangier</h4> Abstract: We introduce Wavesplit, an end-to-end speech separation system. From a single recording of mixed speech, the model infers and clusters representations of each speaker and then estimates each source signal conditioned on the inferred representations. The model is trained on the raw waveform to jointly perform the two tasks. Our model infers a set of speaker representations through clustering, which addresses the fundamental permutation problem of speech separation. Moreover, the sequence-wide speaker representations provide a more robust separation of long, challenging sequences, compared to previous approaches. We show that Wavesplit outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on clean mixtures of 2 or 3 speakers (WSJ0-2mix, WSJ0-3mix), as well as in noisy (WHAM!) and reverberated (WHAMR!) conditions. As an additional contribution, we further improve our model by introducing online data augmentation for separation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08933">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 59	Imputer: Sequence Modelling via Imputation and Dynamic Programming</h3><h4>William Chan, Chitwan Saharia, Geoffrey Hinton, Mohammad Norouzi, Navdeep Jaitly</h4> Abstract: This paper presents the Imputer, a neural sequence model that generates output sequences iteratively via imputations. The Imputer is an iterative generative model, requiring only a constant number of generation steps independent of the number of input or output tokens. The Imputer can be trained to approximately marginalize over all possible alignments between the input and output sequences, and all possible generation orders. We present a tractable dynamic programming training algorithm, which yields a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. When applied to end-to-end speech recognition, the Imputer outperforms prior non-autoregressive models and achieves competitive results to autoregressive models. On LibriSpeech test-other, the Imputer achieves 11.1 WER, outperforming CTC at 13.0 WER and seq2seq at 12.5 WER. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08926">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 60	How Much Knowledge Can You Pack Into the Parameters of a Language Model?</h3><h4>Adam Roberts, Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer</h4> Abstract: It has recently been observed that neural language models trained on unstructured text can implicitly store and retrieve knowledge using natural language queries. In this short paper, we measure the practical utility of this approach by fine-tuning pre-trained models to answer questions without access to any external context or knowledge. We show that this approach scales surprisingly well with model size and outperforms models that explicitly look up knowledge on the open-domain variants of Natural Questions and WebQuestions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08910">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 61	REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training</h3><h4>Kelvin Guu, Kenton Lee, Zora Tung, Panupong Pasupat, Ming-Wei Chang</h4> Abstract: Language model pre-training has been shown to capture a surprising amount of world knowledge, crucial for NLP tasks such as question answering. However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08909">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 62	Second-order Conditional Gradients</h3><h4>Alejandro Carderera, Sebastian Pokutta</h4> Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to the quadratic convergence rates these methods enjoy when close to the optimum. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. In the case where the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information about the function, although possible, is costly, the coupling of constrained second-order and conditional gradient algorithms leads to competitive algorithms with solid theoretical guarantees and good numerical performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08907">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 63	Application of Pre-training Models in Named Entity Recognition</h3><h4>Yu Wang, Yining Sun, Zuchang Ma, Lisheng Gao, Yang Xu, Ting Sun</h4> Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to extract entities from unstructured data. The previous methods for NER were based on machine learning or deep learning. Recently, pre-training models have significantly improved performance on multiple NLP tasks. In this paper, firstly, we introduce the architecture and pre-training tasks of four common pre-training models: BERT, ERNIE, ERNIE2.0-tiny, and RoBERTa. Then, we apply these pre-training models to a NER task by fine-tuning, and compare the effects of the different model architecture and pre-training tasks on the NER task. The experiment results showed that RoBERTa achieved state-of-the-art results on the MSRA-2006 dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08902">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 64	Identifying physical health comorbidities in a cohort of individuals  with severe mental illness: An application of SemEHR</h3><h4>Rebecca Bendayan, Honghan Wu, Zeljko Kraljevic, Robert Stewart, Tom Searle, Jaya Chaturvedi, Jayati Das-Munshi, Zina Ibrahim, Aurelie Mascio, Angus Roberts, Daniel Bean, Richard Dobson</h4> Abstract: Multimorbidity research in mental health services requires data from physical health conditions which is traditionally limited in mental health care electronic health records. In this study, we aimed to extract data from physical health conditions from clinical notes using SemEHR. Data was extracted from Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system at South London and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) and the cohort consisted of all individuals who had received a primary or secondary diagnosis of severe mental illness between 2007 and 2018. Three pairs of annotators annotated 2403 documents with an average Cohen's Kappa of 0.757. Results show that the NLP performance varies across different diseases areas (F1 0.601 - 0.954) suggesting that the language patterns or terminologies of different condition groups entail different technical challenges to the same NLP task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08901">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 65	SynFi: Automatic Synthetic Fingerprint Generation</h3><h4>M. Sadegh Riazi, Seyed M. Chavoshian, Farinaz Koushanfar</h4> Abstract: Authentication and identification methods based on human fingerprints are ubiquitous in several systems ranging from government organizations to consumer products. The performance and reliability of such systems directly rely on the volume of data on which they have been verified. Unfortunately, a large volume of fingerprint databases is not publicly available due to many privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to automatically generate high-fidelity synthetic fingerprints at scale. Our approach relies on (i) Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate the probability distribution of human fingerprints and (ii) Super-Resolution methods to synthesize fine-grained textures. We rigorously test our system and show that our methodology is the first to generate fingerprints that are computationally indistinguishable from real ones, a task that prior art could not accomplish. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08900">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 66	MA-DST: Multi-Attention Based Scalable Dialog State Tracking</h3><h4>Adarsh Kumar, Peter Ku, Anuj Kumar Goyal, Angeliki Metallinou, Dilek Hakkani-Tur</h4> Abstract: Task oriented dialog agents provide a natural language interface for users to complete their goal. Dialog State Tracking (DST), which is often a core component of these systems, tracks the system's understanding of the user's goal throughout the conversation. To enable accurate multi-domain DST, the model needs to encode dependencies between past utterances and slot semantics and understand the dialog context, including long-range cross-domain references. We introduce a novel architecture for this task to encode the conversation history and slot semantics more robustly by using attention mechanisms at multiple granularities. In particular, we use cross-attention to model relationships between the context and slots at different semantic levels and self-attention to resolve cross-domain coreferences. In addition, our proposed architecture does not rely on knowing the domain ontologies beforehand and can also be used in a zero-shot setting for new domains or unseen slot values. Our model improves the joint goal accuracy by 5% (absolute) in the full-data setting and by up to 2% (absolute) in the zero-shot setting over the present state-of-the-art on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08898">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 67	Reliable Distributed Clustering with Redundant Data Assignment</h3><h4>Venkata Gandikota, Arya Mazumdar, Ankit Singh Rawat</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present distributed generalized clustering algorithms that can handle large scale data across multiple machines in spite of straggling or unreliable machines. We propose a novel data assignment scheme that enables us to obtain global information about the entire data even when some machines fail to respond with the results of the assigned local computations. The assignment scheme leads to distributed algorithms with good approximation guarantees for a variety of clustering and dimensionality reduction problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08892">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 68	Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning as a Computational Tool for Language  Evolution Research: Historical Context and Future Challenges</h3><h4>Cl√©ment Moulin-Frier, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</h4> Abstract: Computational models of emergent communication in agent populations are currently gaining interest in the machine learning community due to recent advances in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Current contributions are however still relatively disconnected from the earlier theoretical and computational literature aiming at understanding how language might have emerged from a prelinguistic substance. The goal of this paper is to position recent MARL contributions within the historical context of language evolution research, as well as to extract from this theoretical and computational background a few challenges for future research. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08878">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 69	Halpern Iteration for Near-Optimal and Parameter-Free Monotone Inclusion  and Strong Solutions to Variational Inequalities</h3><h4>Jelena Diakonikolas</h4> Abstract: We leverage the connections between nonexpansive maps, monotone Lipschitz operators, and proximal mappings to obtain near-optimal (i.e., optimal up to poly-log factors in terms of iteration complexity) and parameter-free methods for solving monotone inclusion problems. These results immediately translate into near-optimal guarantees for approximating strong solutions to variational inequality problems, approximating convex-concave min-max optimization problems, and minimizing the norm of the gradient in min-max optimization problems. Our analysis is based on a novel and simple potential-based proof of convergence of Halpern iteration, a classical iteration for finding fixed points of nonexpansive maps. Additionally, we provide a series of algorithmic reductions that highlight connections between different problem classes and lead to lower bounds that certify near-optimality of the studied methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08872">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 70	Fast Differentiable Sorting and Ranking</h3><h4>Mathieu Blondel, Olivier Teboul, Quentin Berthet, Josip Djolonga</h4> Abstract: The sorting operation is one of the most basic and commonly used building blocks in computer programming. In machine learning, it is commonly used for robust statistics. However, seen as a function, it is piecewise linear and as a result includes many kinks at which it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the related ranking operator, commonly used for order statistics and ranking metrics. It is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one would expect from sorting and ranking operations. In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable sorting and ranking operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase two novel applications: differentiable Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and soft least trimmed squares. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08871">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 71	Contextual Lensing of Universal Sentence Representations</h3><h4>Jamie Kiros</h4> Abstract: What makes a universal sentence encoder universal? The notion of a generic encoder of text appears to be at odds with the inherent contextualization and non-permanence of language use in a dynamic world. However, mapping sentences into generic fixed-length vectors for downstream similarity and retrieval tasks has been fruitful, particularly for multilingual applications. How do we manage this dilemma? In this work we propose Contextual Lensing, a methodology for inducing context-oriented universal sentence vectors. We break the construction of universal sentence vectors into a core, variable length, sentence matrix representation equipped with an adaptable `lens' from which fixed-length vectors can be induced as a function of the lens context. We show that it is possible to focus notions of language similarity into a small number of lens parameters given a core universal matrix representation. For example, we demonstrate the ability to encode translation similarity of sentences across several languages into a single weight matrix, even when the core encoder has not seen parallel data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08866">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 72	Bounding the expected run-time of nonconvex optimization with early  stopping</h3><h4>Thomas Flynn, Kwang Min Yu, Abid Malik, Nicolas D'Imperio, Shinjae Yoo</h4> Abstract: This work examines the convergence of stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithms that use early stopping based on a validation function. The form of early stopping we consider is that optimization terminates when the norm of the gradient of a validation function falls below a threshold. We derive conditions that guarantee this stopping rule is well-defined, and provide bounds on the expected number of iterations and gradient evaluations needed to meet this criterion. The guarantee accounts for the distance between the training and validation sets, measured with the Wasserstein distance. We develop the approach in the general setting of a first-order optimization algorithm, with possibly biased update directions subject to a geometric drift condition. We then derive bounds on the expected running time for early stopping variants of several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decentralized SGD (DSGD), and the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. Finally, we consider the generalization properties of the iterate returned by early stopping. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08856">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 73	A General Pairwise Comparison Model for Extremely Sparse Networks</h3><h4>Ruijian Han, Yiming Xu, Kani Chen</h4> Abstract: Statistical inference using pairwise comparison data has been an effective approach to analyzing complex and sparse networks. In this paper we propose a general framework for modeling the mutual interaction in a probabilistic network, which enjoys ample flexibility in terms of parametrization. Within this set-up, we establish that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the latent scores of the subjects is uniformly consistent under a near-minimal condition on network sparsity. This condition is sharp in terms of the leading order asymptotics describing the sparsity. The proof utilizes a novel chaining technique based on the error-induced metric as well as careful counting of comparison graph structures. Our results guarantee that the MLE is a valid estimator for inference in large-scale comparison networks where data is asymptotically deficient. Numerical simulations are provided to complement the theoretical analysis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08853">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 74	Contextual Reserve Price Optimization in Auctions</h3><h4>Joey Huchette, Haihao Lu, Hossein Esfandiari, Vahab Mirrokni</h4> Abstract: We study the problem of learning a linear model to set the reserve price in order to maximize expected revenue in an auction, given contextual information. First, we show that it is not possible to solve this problem in polynomial time unless the \emph{Exponential Time Hypothesis} fails. Second, we present a strong mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for this problem, which is capable of exactly modeling the nonconvex and discontinuous expected reward function. Moreover, we show that this MIP formulation is ideal (the strongest possible formulation) for the revenue function. Since it can be computationally expensive to exactly solve the MIP formulation, we also study the performance of its linear programming (LP) relaxation. We show that, unfortunately, in the worst case the objective gap of the linear programming relaxation can be $O(n)$ times larger than the optimal objective of the actual problem, where $n$ is the number of samples. Finally, we present computational results, showcasing that the mixed-integer programming formulation, along with its linear programming relaxation, are able to superior both the in-sample performance and the out-of-sample performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms on both real and synthetic datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08841">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 75	PA-Cache: Learning-based Popularity-Aware Content Caching in Edge  Networks</h3><h4>Qilin Fan, Jian Li, Xiuhua Li, Qiang He, Shu Fu, Sen Wang</h4> Abstract: With the aggressive growth of smart environments, a large amount of data are generated by edge devices. As a result, content delivery has been quickly pushed to network edges. Compared with classical content delivery networks, edge caches with smaller size usually suffer from more bursty requests, which makes conventional caching algorithms perform poorly in edge networks. This paper aims to propose an effective caching decision policy called PA-Cache that uses evolving deep learning to adaptively learn time-varying content popularity to decide which content to evict when the cache is full. Unlike prior learning-based approaches that either use a small set of features for decision making or require the entire training dataset to be available for learning a fine-tuned but might outdated prediction model, PA-Cache weights a large set of critical features to train the neural network in an evolving manner so as to meet the edge requests with fluctuations and bursts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PA-Cache through extensive experiments with real-world data traces from a large commercial video-on-demand service provider. The evaluation shows that PA-Cache improves the hit rate in comparison with state-of-the-art methods at a lower computational cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08805">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 76	Guiding attention in Sequence-to-sequence models for Dialogue Act  prediction</h3><h4>Pierre Colombo, Emile Chapuis, Matteo Manica, Emmanuel Vignon, Giovanna Varni, Chloe Clavel</h4> Abstract: The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality. Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to the state of the art our model does not require handcrafted features and is trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on MRDA. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08801">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 77	Pruning untrained neural networks: Principles and Analysis</h3><h4>Soufiane Hayou, Jean-Francois Ton, Arnaud Doucet, Yee Whye Teh</h4> Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks display state-of-the art performance. However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks to be able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning pre-trained neural networks (e.g. LeCun et al. (1990) and Hassabi et al. (1993)), recent work by Lee et al. (2018) showed promising results where pruning is performed at initialization. However, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, these procedures do not prevent one layer being fully pruned. In this paper we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of pruning at initialization and training sparse architectures. This analysis allows us to propose novel principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of network architectures. We particularly show that we can prune up to 99.9% of the weights while keeping the model trainable. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08797">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 78	Do you comply with AI? -- Personalized explanations of learning  algorithms and their impact on employees' compliance behavior</h3><h4>NIklas Kuhl, Jodie Lobana, Christian Meske</h4> Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are technological key enablers for artificial intelligence (AI). Due to the inherent complexity, these learning algorithms represent black boxes and are difficult to comprehend, therefore influencing compliance behavior. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of such artifacts, which can impact employees' task performance significantly, is still subject to research - and personalization of AI explanations seems to be a promising concept in this regard. In our work, we hypothesize that, based on varying backgrounds like training, domain knowledge and demographic characteristics, individuals have different understandings and hence mental models about the learning algorithm. Personalization of AI explanations, related to the individuals' mental models, may thus be an instrument to affect compliance and therefore employee task performance. Our preliminary results already indicate the importance of personalized explanations in industry settings and emphasize the importance of this research endeavor. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08777">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 79	Propose, Test, Release: Differentially private estimation with high  probability</h3><h4>Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, Marco Avella-Medina</h4> Abstract: We derive concentration inequalities for differentially private median and mean estimators building on the "Propose, Test, Release" (PTR) mechanism introduced by Dwork and Lei (2009). We introduce a new general version of the PTR mechanism that allows us to derive high probability error bounds for differentially private estimators. Our algorithms provide the first statistical guarantees for differentially private estimation of the median and mean without any boundedness assumptions on the data, and without assuming that the target population parameter lies in some known bounded interval. Our procedures do not rely on any truncation of the data and provide the first sub-Gaussian high probability bounds for differentially private median and mean estimation, for possibly heavy tailed random variables. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08774">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 81	APTER: Aggregated Prognosis Through Exponential Reweighting</h3><h4>Kristiaan Pelckmans, Liu Yang</h4> Abstract: This paper considers the task of learning how to make a prognosis of a patient based on his/her micro-array expression levels. The method is an application of the aggregation method as recently proposed in the literature on theoretical machine learning, and excels in its computational convenience and capability to deal with high-dimensional data. A formal analysis of the method is given, yielding rates of convergence similar to what traditional techniques obtain, while it is shown to cope well with an exponentially large set of features. Those results are supported by numerical simulations on a range of publicly available survival-micro-array datasets. It is empirically found that the proposed technique combined with a recently proposed preprocessing technique gives excellent performances. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08731">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 82	A survey on Semi-, Self- and Unsupervised Techniques in Image  Classification</h3><h4>Lars Schmarje, Monty Santarossa, Simon-Martin Schr√∂der, Reinhard Koch</h4> Abstract: While deep learning strategies achieve outstanding results in computer vision tasks, one issue remains. The current strategies rely heavily on a huge amount of labeled data. In many real-world problems it is not feasible to create such an amount of labeled training data. Therefore, researchers try to incorporate unlabeled data into the training process to reach equal results with fewer labels. Due to a lot of concurrent research, it is difficult to keep track of recent developments. In this survey we provide an overview of often used techniques and methods in image classification with fewer labels. We compare 21 methods. In our analysis we identify three major trends. 1. State-of-the-art methods are scaleable to real world applications based on their accuracy. 2. The degree of supervision which is needed to achieve comparable results to the usage of all labels is decreasing. 3. All methods share common techniques while only few methods combine these techniques to achieve better performance. Based on all of these three trends we discover future research opportunities. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08721">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 83	Automatic Gesture Recognition in Robot-assisted Surgery with  Reinforcement Learning and Tree Search</h3><h4>Xiaojie Gao, Yueming Jin, Qi Dou, Pheng-Ann Heng</h4> Abstract: Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamental for improving intelligence in robot-assisted surgery, such as conducting complicated tasks of surgery surveillance and skill evaluation. However, current methods treat each frame individually and produce the outcomes without effective consideration on future information. In this paper, we propose a framework based on reinforcement learning and tree search for joint surgical gesture segmentation and classification. An agent is trained to segment and classify the surgical video in a human-like manner whose direct decisions are re-considered by tree search appropriately. Our proposed tree search algorithm unites the outputs from two designed neural networks, i.e., policy and value network. With the integration of complementary information from distinct models, our framework is able to achieve the better performance than baseline methods using either of the neural networks. For an overall evaluation, our developed approach consistently outperforms the existing methods on the suturing task of JIGSAWS dataset in terms of accuracy, edit score and F1 score. Our study highlights the utilization of tree search to refine actions in reinforcement learning framework for surgical robotic applications. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08718">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 84	An empirical study of Conv-TasNet</h3><h4>Berkan Kadioglu, Michael Horgan, Xiaoyu Liu, Jordi Pons, Dan Darcy, Vivek Kumar</h4> Abstract: Conv-TasNet is a recently proposed waveform-based deep neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech source separation. Its architecture consists of a learnable encoder/decoder and a separator that operates on top of this learned space. Various improvements have been proposed to Conv-TasNet. However, they mostly focus on the separator, leaving its encoder/decoder as a (shallow) linear operator. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of Conv-TasNet and propose an enhancement to the encoder/decoder that is based on a (deep) non-linear variant of it. In addition, we experiment with the larger and more diverse LibriTTS dataset and investigate the generalization capabilities of the studied models when trained on a much larger dataset. We propose cross-dataset evaluation that includes assessing separations from the WSJ0-2mix, LibriTTS and VCTK databases. Our results show that enhancements to the encoder/decoder can improve average SI-SNR performance by more than 1 dB. Furthermore, we offer insights into the generalization capabilities of Conv-TasNet and the potential value of improvements to the encoder/decoder. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08688">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 85	Learning Gaussian Graphical Models via Multiplicative Weights</h3><h4>Anamay Chaturvedi, Jonathan Scarlett</h4> Abstract: Graphical model selection in Markov random fields is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. Two particularly prominent models, the Ising model and Gaussian model, have largely developed in parallel using different (though often related) techniques, and several practical algorithms with rigorous sample complexity bounds have been established for each. In this paper, we adapt a recently proposed algorithm of Klivans and Meka (FOCS, 2017), based on the method of multiplicative weight updates, from the Ising model to the Gaussian model, via non-trivial modifications to both the algorithm and its analysis. The algorithm enjoys a sample complexity bound that is qualitatively similar to others in the literature, has a low runtime $O(mp^2)$ in the case of $m$ samples and $p$ nodes, and can trivially be implemented in an online manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08663">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 86	Computational Design with Crowds</h3><h4>Yuki Koyama, Takeo Igarashi</h4> Abstract: Computational design is aimed at supporting or automating design processes using computational techniques. However, some classes of design tasks involve criteria that are difficult to handle only with computers. For example, visual design tasks seeking to fulfill aesthetic goals are difficult to handle purely with computers. One promising approach is to leverage human computation; that is, to incorporate human input into the computation process. Crowdsourcing platforms provide a convenient way to integrate such human computation into a working system. In this chapter, we discuss such computational design with crowds in the domain of parameter tweaking tasks in visual design. Parameter tweaking is often performed to maximize the aesthetic quality of designed objects. Computational design powered by crowds can solve this maximization problem by leveraging human computation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of computational design with crowds with two illustrative examples: (1) estimating the objective function (specifically, preference learning from crowds' pairwise comparisons) to facilitate interactive design exploration by a designer and (2) directly searching for the optimal parameter setting that maximizes the objective function (specifically, crowds-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08657">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 87	Balancing Cost and Benefit with Tied-Multi Transformers</h3><h4>Raj Dabre, Raphael Rubino, Atsushi Fujita</h4> Abstract: We propose and evaluate a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers with tied parameters which compresses multiple models into one enabling the dynamic choice of the number of encoder and decoder layers during decoding. In sequence-to-sequence modeling, typically, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of NxM losses, where each loss is computed from the output of one of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a model subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers, and can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and decoder layers. We then propose a mechanism to choose a priori the number of encoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and also explore recurrent stacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present a cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine translation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving translation quality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08614">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 88	KaoKore: A Pre-modern Japanese Art Facial Expression Dataset</h3><h4>Yingtao Tian, Chikahiko Suzuki, Tarin Clanuwat, Mikel Bober-Irizar, Alex Lamb, Asanobu Kitamoto</h4> Abstract: From classifying handwritten digits to generating strings of text, the datasets which have received long-time focus from the machine learning community vary greatly in their subject matter. This has motivated a renewed interest in building datasets which are socially and culturally relevant, so that algorithmic research may have a more direct and immediate impact on society. One such area is in history and the humanities, where better and relevant machine learning models can accelerate research across various fields. To this end, newly released benchmarks and models have been proposed for transcribing historical Japanese cursive writing, yet for the field as a whole using machine learning for historical Japanese artworks still remains largely uncharted. To bridge this gap, in this work we propose a new dataset KaoKore which consists of faces extracted from pre-modern Japanese artwork. We demonstrate its value as both a dataset for image classification as well as a creative and artistic dataset, which we explore using generative models.

<h3>No. 89	Syndrome-aware Herb Recommendation with Multi-Graph Convolution Network</h3><h4>Yuanyuan Jin, Wei Zhang, Xiangnan He, Xinyu Wang, Xiaoling Wang</h4> Abstract: Herb recommendation plays a crucial role in the therapeutic process of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), which aims to recommend a set of herbs to treat the symptoms of a patient. While several machine learning methods have been developed for herb recommendation, they are limited in modeling only the interactions between herbs and symptoms, and ignoring the intermediate process of syndrome induction. When performing TCM diagnostics, an experienced doctor typically induces syndromes from the patient's symptoms and then suggests herbs based on the induced syndromes. As such, we believe the induction of syndromes, an overall description of the symptoms, is important for herb recommendation and should be properly handled. However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of syndrome induction, most prescriptions lack the explicit ground truth of syndromes. In this paper, we propose a new method that takes the implicit syndrome induction process into account for herb recommendation. Given a set of symptoms to treat, we aim to generate an overall syndrome representation by effectively fusing the embeddings of all the symptoms in the set, to mimic how a doctor induces the syndromes. Towards symptom embedding learning, we additionally construct a symptom-symptom graph from the input prescriptions for capturing the relations between symptoms; we then build graph convolution networks(GCNs) on both symptom-symptom and symptom-herb graphs to learn symptom embedding. Similarly, we construct a herb-herb graph and build GCNs on both herb-herb and symptom-herb graphs to learn herb embedding, which is finally interacted with the syndrome representation to predict the scores of herbs. In this way, more comprehensive representations can be obtained. We conduct extensive experiments on a public TCM dataset, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art herb recommendation methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08575">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 90	The continuous categorical: a novel simplex-valued exponential family</h3><h4>Elliott Gordon-Rodriguez, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem, John P. Cunningham</h4> Abstract: Simplex-valued data appear throughout statistics and machine learning, for example in the context of transfer learning and compression of deep networks. Existing models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data - the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08563">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 91	Federated pretraining and fine tuning of BERT using clinical notes from  multiple silos</h3><h4>Dianbo Liu, Tim Miller</h4> Abstract: Large scale contextual representation models, such as BERT, have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) in recently years. However, in certain area like healthcare, accessing diverse large scale text data from multiple institutions is extremely challenging due to privacy and regulatory reasons. In this article, we show that it is possible to both pretrain and fine tune BERT models in a federated manner using clinical texts from different silos without moving the data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08562">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 92	Learning to Walk in the Real World with Minimal Human Effort</h3><h4>Sehoon Ha, Peng Xu, Zhenyu Tan, Sergey Levine, Jie Tan</h4> Abstract: Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental challenges for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged as a promising method for developing such control policies autonomously. In this paper, we develop a system for learning legged locomotion policies with deep RL in the real world with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for on-robot learning systems are automatic data collection and safety. We overcome these two challenges by developing a multi-task learning procedure, an automatic reset controller, and a safety-constrained RL framework. We tested our system on the task of learning to walk on three different terrains: flat ground, a soft mattress, and a doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently learn locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08550">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 93	Do We Really Need to Access the Source Data? Source Hypothesis Transfer  for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Jian Liang, Dapeng Hu, Jiashi Feng</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to leverage the knowledge learned from a labeled source dataset to solve similar tasks in a new unlabeled domain. Prior UDA methods typically require to access the source data when learning to adapt the model, making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. In this work we tackle a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and investigate how we can effectively utilize such a model without source data to solve UDA problems. To this end, we propose a simple yet generic representation learning framework, named \emph{Source HypOthesis Transfer} (SHOT). Specifically, SHOT freezes the classifier module (hypothesis) of the source model and learns the target-specific feature extraction module by exploiting both information maximization and self-supervised pseudo-labeling to implicitly align representations from the target domains to the source hypothesis. In this way, the learned target model can directly predict the labels of target data. We further investigate several techniques to refine the network architecture to parameterize the source model for better transfer performance. To verify its versatility, we evaluate SHOT in a variety of adaptation cases including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set domain adaptation. Experiments indicate that SHOT yields state-of-the-art results among multiple domain adaptation benchmarks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08546">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 94	A Scalable Framework for Sparse Clustering Without Shrinkage</h3><h4>Zhiyue Zhang, Kenneth Lange, Jason Xu</h4> Abstract: Clustering, a fundamental activity in unsupervised learning, is notoriously difficult when the feature space is high-dimensional. Fortunately, in many realistic scenarios, only a handful of features are relevant in distinguishing clusters. This has motivated the development of sparse clustering techniques that typically rely on k-means within outer algorithms of high computational complexity. Current techniques also require careful tuning of shrinkage parameters, further limiting their scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for sparse k-means clustering that is intuitive, simple to implement, and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. We show that our algorithm enjoys consistency and convergence guarantees. Our core method readily generalizes to several task-specific algorithms such as clustering on subsets of attributes and in partially observed data settings. We showcase these contributions via simulated experiments and benchmark datasets, as well as a case study on mouse protein expression. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08541">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 95	Adaptive Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation</h3><h4>Tao Sun, Han Shen, Tianyi Chen, Dongsheng Li</h4> Abstract: This paper revisits the celebrated temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm for the policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Typically, the performance of the plain-vanilla TD algorithm is sensitive to the choice of stepsizes. Oftentimes, TD suffers from slow convergence. Motivated by the tight connection between the TD learning algorithm and the stochastic gradient methods, we develop the first adaptive variant of the TD learning algorithm with linear function approximation that we term AdaTD. In contrast to the original TD, AdaTD is robust or less sensitive to the choice of stepsizes. Analytically, we establish that to reach an $\epsilon$ accuracy, the number of iterations needed is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^2\ln^4\frac{1}{\epsilon}/\ln^4\frac{1}{\rho})$, where $\rho$ represents the speed of the underlying Markov chain converges to the stationary distribution. This implies that the iteration complexity of AdaTD is no worse than that of TD in the worst case. Going beyond TD, we further develop an adaptive variant of TD($\lambda$), which is referred to as AdaTD($\lambda$). We evaluate the empirical performance of AdaTD and AdaTD($\lambda$) on several standard reinforcement learning tasks in OpenAI Gym on both linear and nonlinear function approximation, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approaches over existing ones. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08537">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 96	Towards Physically-consistent, Data-driven Models of Convection</h3><h4>Tom Beucler, Michael Pritchard, Pierre Gentine, Stephan Rasp</h4> Abstract: Data-driven algorithms, in particular neural networks, can emulate the effect of sub-grid scale processes in coarse-resolution climate models if trained on high-resolution climate simulations. However, they may violate key physical constraints and lack the ability to generalize outside of their training set. Here, we show that physical constraints can be enforced in neural networks, either approximately by adapting the loss function or to machine precision by adapting the architecture. As these physical constraints are insufficient to guarantee generalizability, we additionally propose a framework to find physical normalizations that can be applied to the training and validation data to improve the ability of neural networks to generalize to unseen climates. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 97	Pulsars Detection by Machine Learning with Very Few Features</h3><h4>Haitao Lin, Xiangru Li, Ziying Luo</h4> Abstract: It is an active topic to investigate the schemes based on machine learning (ML) methods for detecting pulsars as the data volume growing exponentially in modern surveys. To improve the detection performance, input features into an ML model should be investigated specifically. In the existing pulsar detection researches based on ML methods, there are mainly two kinds of feature designs: the empirical features and statistical features. Due to the combinational effects from multiple features, however, there exist some redundancies and even irrelevant components in the available features, which can reduce the accuracy of a pulsar detection model. Therefore, it is essential to select a subset of relevant features from a set of available candidate features and known as {\itshape feature selection.} In this work, two feature selection algorithms ----\textit{Grid Search} (GS) and \textit{Recursive Feature Elimination} (RFE)---- are proposed to improve the detection performance by removing the redundant and irrelevant features. The algorithms were evaluated on the Southern High Time Resolution University survey (HTRU-S) with five pulsar detection models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed feature selection algorithms. By the GS, a model with only two features reach a recall rate as high as 99\% and a false positive rate (FPR) as low as 0.65\%; By the RFE, another model with only three features achieves a recall rate 99\% and an FPR of 0.16\% in pulsar candidates classification. Furthermore, this work investigated the number of features required as well as the misclassified pulsars by our models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08519">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 98	Causal Inference under Networked Interference</h3><h4>Yunpu Ma, Yuyi Wang, Volker Tresp</h4> Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments or observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment responses under interference. Hence, how to estimate the superimposed causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference becomes a challenging task in causal inference. In this work, we study causal effect estimation under general network interference using GNNs, which are powerful tools for capturing the dependency in the graph. After deriving causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference and treatment capacity constraint. Furthermore, a heuristic graph structure-dependent error bound for GNN-based causal estimators is provided. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08506">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 99	Stochastic Regret Minimization in Extensive-Form Games</h3><h4>Gabriele Farina, Christian Kroer, Tuomas Sandholm</h4> Abstract: Monte-Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving sequential games that are too large for full tree traversals. It works by using gradient estimates that can be computed via sampling. However, stochastic methods for sequential games have not been investigated extensively beyond MCCFR. In this paper we develop a new framework for developing stochastic regret minimization methods. This framework allows us to use any regret-minimization algorithm, coupled with any gradient estimator. The MCCFR algorithm can be analyzed as a special case of our framework, and this analysis leads to significantly-stronger theoretical on convergence, while simultaneously yielding a simplified proof. Our framework allows us to instantiate several new stochastic methods for solving sequential games. We show extensive experiments on three games, where some variants of our methods outperform MCCFR. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08493">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 100	Entrywise convergence of iterative methods for eigenproblems</h3><h4>Vasileios Charisopoulos, Austin R. Benson, Anil Damle</h4> Abstract: Several problems in machine learning, statistics, and other fields rely on computing eigenvectors. For large scale problems, the computation of these eigenvectors is typically performed via iterative schemes such as subspace iteration or Krylov methods. While there is classical and comprehensive analysis for subspace convergence guarantees with respect to the spectral norm, in many modern applications other notions of subspace distance are more appropriate. Recent theoretical work has focused on perturbations of subspaces measured in the $\ell_{2 \to \infty}$ norm, but does not consider the actual computation of eigenvectors. Here we address the convergence of subspace iteration when distances are measured in the $\ell_{2 \to \infty}$ norm and provide deterministic bounds. We complement our analysis with a practical stopping criterion and demonstrate its applicability via numerical experiments. Our results show that one can get comparable performance on downstream tasks while requiring fewer iterations, thereby saving substantial computational time. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08491">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 101	The Information in Emotion Communication</h3><h4>Alison Duncan Kerr, Kevin Scharp</h4> Abstract: How much information is transmitted when animals use emotions to communicate? It is clear that emotions are used as communication systems in humans and other species. The quantitative theory of emotion information presented here is based on Shannon's mathematical theory of information in communication systems. The theory explains myriad aspects of emotion communication and offers dozens of new directions for research. It is superior to the "contagion" theory of emotion spreading, which is currently dominant. One important application of the information theory of emotion communication is that it permits the development of emotion security systems for social networks to guard against the widespread emotion manipulation we see online today. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08470">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 102	Descriptive and Predictive Analysis of Euroleague Basketball Games and  the Wisdom of Basketball Crowds</h3><h4>Georgios Giasemidis</h4> Abstract: In this study we focus on the prediction of basketball games in the Euroleague competition using machine learning modelling. The prediction is a binary classification problem, predicting whether a match finishes 1 (home win) or 2 (away win). Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the "wisdom of the basketball crowd" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study. We argue why the accuracy level of this group of "experts" should be set as the benchmark for future studies in the prediction of (European) basketball games using machine learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08465">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 103	From Poincar√© Recurrence to Convergence in Imperfect Information  Games: Finding Equilibrium via Regularization</h3><h4>Julien Perolat, Remi Munos, Jean-Baptiste Lespiau, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Mark Rowland, Pedro Ortega, Neil Burch, Thomas Anthony, David Balduzzi, Bart De Vylder, Georgios Piliouras, Marc Lanctot, Karl Tuyls</h4> Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Follow the Regularized Leader dynamics in sequential imperfect information games (IIG). We generalize existing results of Poincar\'e recurrence from normal-form games to zero-sum two-player imperfect information games and other sequential game settings. We then investigate how adapting the reward (by adding a regularization term) of the game can give strong convergence guarantees in monotone games. We continue by showing how this reward adaptation technique can be leveraged to build algorithms that converge exactly to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we show how these insights can be directly used to build state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for zero-sum two-player Imperfect Information Games (IIG). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08456">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 104	SD-GAN: Structural and Denoising GAN reveals facial parts under  occlusion</h3><h4>Samik Banerjee, Sukhendu Das</h4> Abstract: Certain facial parts are salient (unique) in appearance, which substantially contribute to the holistic recognition of a subject. Occlusion of these salient parts deteriorates the performance of face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generative model to reconstruct the missing parts of the face which are under occlusion. The proposed generative model (SD-GAN) reconstructs a face preserving the illumination variation and identity of the face. A novel adversarial training algorithm has been designed for a bimodal mutually exclusive Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, for faster convergence. A novel adversarial "structural" loss function is also proposed, comprising of two components: a holistic and a local loss, characterized by SSIM and patch-wise MSE. Ablation studies on real and synthetically occluded face datasets reveal that our proposed technique outperforms the competing methods by a considerable margin, even for boosting the performance of Face Recognition. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08448">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 105	Simultaneous Inference for Massive Data: Distributed Bootstrap</h3><h4>Yang Yu, Shih-Kang Chao, Guang Cheng</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bootstrap method applied to massive data processed distributedly in a large number of machines. This new method is computationally efficient in that we bootstrap on the master machine without over-resampling, typically required by existing methods \cite{kleiner2014scalable,sengupta2016subsampled}, while provably achieving optimal statistical efficiency with minimal communication. Our method does not require repeatedly re-fitting the model but only applies multiplier bootstrap in the master machine on the gradients received from the worker machines. Simulations validate our theory. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08443">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 106	Fine tuning U-Net for ultrasound image segmentation: which layers?</h3><h4>Mina Amiri, Rupert Brooks, Hassan Rivaz</h4> Abstract: Fine-tuning a network which has been trained on a large dataset is an alternative to full training in order to overcome the problem of scarce and expensive data in medical applications. While the shallow layers of the network are usually kept unchanged, deeper layers are modified according to the new dataset. This approach may not work for ultrasound images due to their drastically different appearance. In this study, we investigated the effect of fine-tuning different layers of a U-Net which was trained on segmentation of natural images in breast ultrasound image segmentation. Tuning the contracting part and fixing the expanding part resulted in substantially better results compared to fixing the contracting part and tuning the expanding part. Furthermore, we showed that starting to fine-tune the U-Net from the shallow layers and gradually including more layers will lead to a better performance compared to fine-tuning the network from the deep layers moving back to shallow layers. We did not observe the same results on segmentation of X-ray images, which have different salient features compared to ultrasound, it may therefore be more appropriate to fine-tune the shallow layers rather than deep layers. Shallow layers learn lower level features (including speckle pattern, and probably the noise and artifact properties) which are critical in automatic segmentation in this modality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08438">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 107	Residual Bootstrap Exploration for Bandit Algorithms</h3><h4>Chi-Hua Wang, Yang Yu, Botao Hao, Guang Cheng</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel perturbation-based exploration method in bandit algorithms with bounded or unbounded rewards, called residual bootstrap exploration (\texttt{ReBoot}). The \texttt{ReBoot} enforces exploration by injecting data-driven randomness through a residual-based perturbation mechanism. This novel mechanism captures the underlying distributional properties of fitting errors, and more importantly boosts exploration to escape from suboptimal solutions (for small sample sizes) by inflating variance level in an \textit{unconventional} way. In theory, with appropriate variance inflation level, \texttt{ReBoot} provably secures instance-dependent logarithmic regret in Gaussian multi-armed bandits. We evaluate the \texttt{ReBoot} in different synthetic multi-armed bandits problems and observe that the \texttt{ReBoot} performs better for unbounded rewards and more robustly than \texttt{Giro} \cite{kveton2018garbage} and \texttt{PHE} \cite{kveton2019perturbed}, with comparable computational efficiency to the Thompson sampling method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08436">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 108	Weakly-supervised Multi-output Regression via Correlated Gaussian  Processes</h3><h4>Seokhyun Chung, Raed Al Kontar, Zhenke Wu</h4> Abstract: Multi-output regression seeks to infer multiple latent functions using data from multiple groups/sources while accounting for potential between-group similarities. In this paper, we consider multi-output regression under a weakly-supervised setting where a subset of data points from multiple groups are unlabeled. We use dependent Gaussian processes for multiple outputs constructed by convolutions with shared latent processes. We introduce hyperpriors for the multinomial probabilities of the unobserved labels and optimize the hyperparameters which we show improves estimation. We derive two variational bounds: (i) a modified variational bound for fast and stable convergence in model inference, (ii) a scalable variational bound that is amenable to stochastic optimization. We use experiments on synthetic and real-world data to show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with more accurate estimation of multiple latent functions and unobserved labels. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08412">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 109	A Unified Framework for Gaussian Mixture Reduction with Composite  Transportation Distance</h3><h4>Qiong Zhang, Jiahua Chen</h4> Abstract: Gaussian mixture reduction (GMR) is the problem of approximating a finite Gaussian mixture by one with fewer components. It is widely used in density estimation, nonparametric belief propagation, and Bayesian recursive filtering. Although optimization and clustering-based algorithms have been proposed for GMR, they are either computationally expensive or lacking in theoretical supports. In this work, we propose to perform GMR by minimizing the entropic regularized composite transportation distance between two mixtures. We show our approach provides a unified framework for GMR that is both interpretable and computationally efficient. Our work also bridges the gap between optimization and clustering-based approaches for GMR. A Majorization-Minimization algorithm is developed for our optimization problem and its theoretical convergence is also established in this paper. Empirical experiments are also conducted to show the effectiveness of GMR. The effect of the choice of transportation cost on the performance of GMR is also investigated. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08410">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 110	Implicit Regularization of Random Feature Models</h3><h4>Arthur Jacot, Berfin ≈ûim≈üek, Francesco Spadaro, Cl√©ment Hongler, Franck Gabriel</h4> Abstract: Random Feature (RF) models are used as efficient parametric approximations of kernel methods. We investigate, by means of random matrix theory, the connection between Gaussian RF models and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). For a Gaussian RF model with $P$ features, $N$ data points, and a ridge $\lambda$, we show that the average (i.e. expected) RF predictor is close to a KRR predictor with an effective ridge $\tilde{\lambda}$. We show that $\tilde{\lambda} > \lambda$ and $\tilde{\lambda} \searrow \lambda$ monotonically as $P$ grows, thus revealing the implicit regularization effect of finite RF sampling. We then compare the risk (i.e. test error) of the $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor with the average risk of the $\lambda$-RF predictor and obtain a precise and explicit bound on their difference. Finally, we empirically find an extremely good agreement between the test errors of the average $\lambda$-RF predictor and $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08404">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 111	MonoLayout: Amodal scene layout from a single image</h3><h4>Kaustubh Mani, Swapnil Daga, Shubhika Garg, N. Sai Shankar, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, K. Madhava Krishna</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the novel, highly challenging problem of estimating the layout of a complex urban driving scenario. Given a single color image captured from a driving platform, we aim to predict the bird's-eye view layout of the road and other traffic participants. The estimated layout should reason beyond what is visible in the image, and compensate for the loss of 3D information due to projection. We dub this problem amodal scene layout estimation, which involves "hallucinating" scene layout for even parts of the world that are occluded in the image. To this end, we present MonoLayout, a deep neural network for real-time amodal scene layout estimation from a single image. We represent scene layout as a multi-channel semantic occupancy grid, and leverage adversarial feature learning to hallucinate plausible completions for occluded image parts. Due to the lack of fair baseline methods, we extend several state-of-the-art approaches for road-layout estimation and vehicle occupancy estimation in bird's-eye view to the amodal setup for rigorous evaluation. By leveraging temporal sensor fusion to generate training labels, we significantly outperform current art over a number of datasets. On the KITTI and Argoverse datasets, we outperform all baselines by a significant margin. We also make all our annotations, and code publicly available.

<h3>No. 112	Comparative Visual Analytics for Assessing Medical Records with Sequence  Embedding</h3><h4>Rongchen Guo, Takanori Fujiwara, Yiran Li, Kelly M. Lima, Soman Sen, Nam K. Tran, Kwan-Liu Ma</h4> Abstract: Machine learning for data-driven diagnosis has been actively studied in medicine to provide better healthcare. Supporting analysis of a patient cohort similar to a patient under treatment is a key task for clinicians to make decisions with high confidence. However, such analysis is not straightforward due to the characteristics of medical records: high dimensionality, irregularity in time, and sparsity. To address this challenge, we introduce a method for similarity calculation of medical records. Our method employs event and sequence embeddings. While we use an autoencoder for the event embedding, we apply its variant with the self-attention mechanism for the sequence embedding. Moreover, in order to better handle the irregularity of data, we enhance the self-attention mechanism with consideration of different time intervals. We have developed a visual analytics system to support comparative studies of patient records. To make a comparison of sequences with different lengths easier, our system incorporates a sequence alignment method. Through its interactive interface, the user can quickly identify patients of interest and conveniently review both the temporal and multivariate aspects of the patient records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and system with case studies using a real-world dataset from the neonatal intensive care unit of UC Davis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08356">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 113	Optimal Multiple Stopping Rule for Warm-Starting Sequential Selection</h3><h4>Mathilde Fekom, Nicolas Vayatis, Argyris Kalogeratos</h4> Abstract: In this paper we present the Warm-starting Dynamic Thresholding algorithm, developed using dynamic programming, for a variant of the standard online selection problem. The problem allows job positions to be either free or already occupied at the beginning of the process. Throughout the selection process, the decision maker interviews one after the other the new candidates and reveals a quality score for each of them. Based on that information, she can (re)assign each job at most once by taking immediate and irrevocable decisions. We relax the hard requirement of the class of dynamic programming algorithms to perfectly know the distribution from which the scores of candidates are drawn, by presenting extensions for the partial and no-information cases, in which the decision maker can learn the underlying score distribution sequentially while interviewing candidates. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.05160">PDF</a><h2>2020-02-23</h2>
<h3>No. 1	Improving Sampling Accuracy of Stochastic Gradient MCMC Methods via  Non-uniform Subsampling of Gradients</h3><h4>Ruilin Li, Xin Wang, Hongyuan Zha, Molei Tao</h4> Abstract: Common Stochastic Gradient MCMC methods approximate gradients by stochastic ones via uniformly subsampled data points. We propose that a non-uniform subsampling can reduce the variance introduced by the stochastic approximation, hence making the sampling of a target distribution more accurate. An exponentially weighted stochastic gradient approach (EWSG) is developed for this objective by matching the transition kernels of SG-MCMC methods respectively based on stochastic and batch gradients. A demonstration of EWSG combined with second-order Langevin equation for sampling purposes is provided. In our method, non-uniform subsampling is done efficiently via a Metropolis-Hasting chain on the data index, which is coupled to the sampling algorithm. The fact that our method has reduced local variance with high probability is theoretically analyzed. A non-asymptotic global error analysis is also presented. Numerical experiments based on both synthetic and real world data sets are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches. While statistical accuracy has improved, the speed of convergence was empirically observed to be at least comparable to the uniform version. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08949">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Nystr√∂m Subspace Learning for Large-scale SVMs</h3><h4>Weida Li, Mingxia Liu, Daoqiang Zhang</h4> Abstract: As an implementation of the Nystr\"{o}m method, Nystr\"{o}m computational regularization (NCR) imposed on kernel classification and kernel ridge regression has proven capable of achieving optimal bounds in the large-scale statistical learning setting, while enjoying much better time complexity. In this study, we propose a Nystr\"{o}m subspace learning (NSL) framework to reveal that all you need for employing the Nystr\"{o}m method, including NCR, upon any kernel SVM is to use the efficient off-the-shelf linear SVM solvers as a black box. Based on our analysis, the bounds developed for the Nystr\"{o}m method are linked to NSL, and the analytical difference between two distinct implementations of the Nystr\"{o}m method is clearly presented. Besides, NSL also leads to sharper theoretical results for the clustered Nystr\"{o}m method. Finally, both regression and classification tasks are performed to compare two implementations of the Nystr\"{o}m method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08937">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Meta-learning for mixed linear regression</h3><h4>Weihao Kong, Raghav Somani, Zhao Song, Sham Kakade, Sewoong Oh</h4> Abstract: In modern supervised learning, there are a large number of tasks, but many of them are associated with only a small amount of labeled data. These include data from medical image processing and robotic interaction. Even though each individual task cannot be meaningfully trained in isolation, one seeks to meta-learn across the tasks from past experiences by exploiting some similarities. We study a fundamental question of interest: When can abundant tasks with small data compensate for lack of tasks with big data? We focus on a canonical scenario where each task is drawn from a mixture of $k$ linear regressions, and identify sufficient conditions for such a graceful exchange to hold; The total number of examples necessary with only small data tasks scales similarly as when big data tasks are available. To this end, we introduce a novel spectral approach and show that we can efficiently utilize small data tasks with the help of $\tilde\Omega(k^{3/2})$ medium data tasks each with $\tilde\Omega(k^{1/2})$ examples. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08936">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Online high rank matrix completion</h3><h4>Jicong Fan, Madeleine Udell</h4> Abstract: Recent advances in matrix completion enable data imputation in full-rank matrices by exploiting low dimensional (nonlinear) latent structure. In this paper, we develop a new model for high rank matrix completion (HRMC), together with batch and online methods to fit the model and out-of-sample extension to complete new data. The method works by (implicitly) mapping the data into a high dimensional polynomial feature space using the kernel trick; importantly, the data occupies a low dimensional subspace in this feature space, even when the original data matrix is of full-rank. We introduce an explicit parametrization of this low dimensional subspace, and an online fitting procedure, to reduce computational complexity compared to the state of the art. The online method can also handle streaming or sequential data and adapt to non-stationary latent structure. We provide guidance on the sampling rate required these methods to succeed. Experimental results on synthetic data and motion capture data validate the performance of the proposed methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08934">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Multi-step Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>J. H. Moon, Debasmit Das, C. S. George Lee</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OUDA) problem, where the target data are unlabelled and arriving sequentially. The traditional methods on the OUDA problem mainly focus on transforming each arriving target data to the source domain, and they do not sufficiently consider the temporal coherency and accumulative statistics among the arriving target data. We propose a multi-step framework for the OUDA problem, which institutes a novel method to compute the mean-target subspace inspired by the geometrical interpretation on the Euclidean space. This mean-target subspace contains accumulative temporal information among the arrived target data. Moreover, the transformation matrix computed from the mean-target subspace is applied to the next target data as a preprocessing step, aligning the target data closer to the source domain. Experiments on four datasets demonstrated the contribution of each step in our proposed multi-step OUDA framework and its performance over previous approaches. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08930">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Regularized Autoencoders via Relaxed Injective Probability Flow</h3><h4>Abhishek Kumar, Ben Poole, Kevin Murphy</h4> Abstract: Invertible flow-based generative models are an effective method for learning to generate samples, while allowing for tractable likelihood computation and inference. However, the invertibility requirement restricts models to have the same latent dimensionality as the inputs. This imposes significant architectural, memory, and computational costs, making them more challenging to scale than other classes of generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a generative model based on probability flows that does away with the bijectivity requirement on the model and only assumes injectivity. This also provides another perspective on regularized autoencoders (RAEs), with our final objectives resembling RAEs with specific regularizers that are derived by lower bounding the probability flow objective. We empirically demonstrate the promise of the proposed model, improving over VAEs and AEs in terms of sample quality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08927">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Dissipative SymODEN: Encoding Hamiltonian Dynamics with Dissipation and  Control into Deep Learning</h3><h4>Yaofeng Desmond Zhong, Biswadip Dey, Amit Chakraborty</h4> Abstract: In this work, we introduce Dissipative SymODEN, a deep learning architecture which can infer the dynamics of a physical system with dissipation from observed state trajectories. To improve prediction accuracy while reducing network size, Dissipative SymODEN encodes the port-Hamiltonian dynamics with energy dissipation and external input into the design of its computation graph and learns the dynamics in a structured way. The learned model, by revealing key aspects of the system, such as the inertia, dissipation, and potential energy, paves the way for energy-based controllers. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08860">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	A Bayes-Optimal View on Adversarial Examples</h3><h4>Eitan Richardson, Yair Weiss</h4> Abstract: The ability to fool modern CNN classifiers with tiny perturbations of the input has lead to the development of a large number of candidate defenses and often conflicting explanations. In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial examples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct realistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be efficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions so that the optimal classifier is either robust or vulnerable. By training different classifiers on these datasets (for which the "gold standard" optimal classifiers are known), we can disentangle the possible sources of vulnerability and avoid the accuracy-robustness tradeoff that may occur in commonly used datasets. Our results show that even when the optimal classifier is robust, standard CNN training consistently learns a vulnerable classifier. At the same time, for exactly the same training data, RBF SVMs consistently learn a robust classifier. The same trend is observed in experiments with real images. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08859">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	On the Decision Boundaries of Deep Neural Networks: A Tropical Geometry  Perspective</h3><h4>Motasem Alfarra, Adel Bibi, Hasan Hammoud, Mohamed Gaafar, Bernard Ghanem</h4> Abstract: This work tackles the problem of characterizing and understanding the decision boundaries of neural networks with piecewise linear non-linearity activations. We use tropical geometry, a new development in the area of algebraic geometry, to characterize the decision boundaries of a simple neural network of the form (Affine, ReLU, Affine). Our main finding is that the decision boundaries are a subset of a tropical hypersurface, which is intimately related to a polytope formed by the convex hull of two zonotopes. The generators of these zonotopes are functions of the neural network parameters. This geometric characterization provides new perspective to three tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tropical perspective to the lottery ticket hypothesis, where we see the effect of different initializations on the tropical geometric representation of a network's decision boundaries. Moreover, we use this characterization to propose a new set of tropical regularizers, which directly deal with the decision boundaries of a network. We investigate the use of these regularizers in neural network pruning (by removing network parameters that do not contribute to the tropical geometric representation of the decision boundaries) and in generating adversarial input attacks (by producing input perturbations that explicitly perturb the decision boundaries' geometry and ultimately change the network's prediction). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08838">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	No-Regret and Incentive-Compatible Online Learning</h3><h4>Rupert Freeman, David M. Pennock, Chara Podimata, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan</h4> Abstract: We study online learning settings in which experts act strategically to maximize their influence on the learning algorithm's predictions by potentially misreporting their beliefs about a sequence of binary events. Our goal is twofold. First, we want the learning algorithm to be no-regret with respect to the best fixed expert in hindsight. Second, we want incentive compatibility, a guarantee that each expert's best strategy is to report his true beliefs about the realization of each event. To achieve this goal, we build on the literature on wagering mechanisms, a type of multi-agent scoring rule. We provide algorithms that achieve no regret and incentive compatibility for myopic experts for both the full and partial information settings. In experiments on datasets from FiveThirtyEight, our algorithms have regret comparable to classic no-regret algorithms, which are not incentive-compatible. Finally, we identify an incentive-compatible algorithm for forward-looking strategic agents that exhibits diminishing regret in practice. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08837">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Differential Dynamic Programming Neural Optimizer</h3><h4>Guan-Horng Liu, Tianrong Chen, Evangelos A. Theodorou</h4> Abstract: Interpretation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training as an optimal control problem with nonlinear dynamical systems has received considerable attention recently, yet the algorithmic development remains relatively limited. In this work, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training procedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most widely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order trajectory optimization algorithm rooted in the Approximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new variant of DDP that can accept batch optimization for training feedforward networks, while integrating naturally with the recent progress in curvature approximation. The resulting algorithm features layer-wise feedback policies which improve convergence rate and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing methods. We show that the algorithm is competitive against state-ofthe-art first and second order methods. Our work opens up new avenues for principled algorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08809">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Support-weighted Adversarial Imitation Learning</h3><h4>Ruohan Wang, Carlo Ciliberto, Pierluigi Amadori, Yiannis Demiris</h4> Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a broad family of imitation learning methods designed to mimic expert behaviors from demonstrations. While AIL has shown state-of-the-art performance on imitation learning with only small number of demonstrations, it faces several practical challenges such as potential training instability and implicit reward bias. To address the challenges, we propose Support-weighted Adversarial Imitation Learning (SAIL), a general framework that extends a given AIL algorithm with information derived from support estimation of the expert policies. SAIL improves the quality of the reinforcement signals by weighing the adversarial reward with a confidence score from support estimation of the expert policy. We also show that SAIL is always at least as efficient as the underlying AIL algorithm that SAIL uses for learning the adversarial reward. Empirically, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance and training stability than baseline methods on a wide range of benchmark control tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08803">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	A Structured Prediction Approach for Conditional Meta-Learning</h3><h4>Ruohan Wang, Yiannis Demiris, Carlo Ciliberto</h4> Abstract: Optimization-based meta-learning algorithms are a powerful class of methods for learning-to-learn applications such as few-shot learning. They tackle the limited availability of training data by leveraging the experience gained from previously observed tasks. However, when the complexity of the tasks distribution cannot be captured by a single set of shared meta-parameters, existing methods may fail to fully adapt to a target task. We address this issue with a novel perspective on conditional meta-learning based on structured prediction. We propose task-adaptive structured meta-learning (TASML), a principled estimator that weighs meta-training data conditioned on the target task to design tailored meta-learning objectives. In addition, we introduce algorithmic improvements to tackle key computational limitations of existing methods. Experimentally, we show that TASML outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. An ablation study quantifies the individual contribution of model components and suggests useful practices for meta-learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08799">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	How To Avoid Being Eaten By a Grue: Exploration Strategies for  Text-Adventure Agents</h3><h4>Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Ethan Tien, Zhaochen Luo, Mark O. Riedl</h4> Abstract: Text-based games -- in which an agent interacts with the world through textual natural language -- present us with the problem of combinatorially-sized action-spaces. Most current reinforcement learning algorithms are not capable of effectively handling such a large number of possible actions per turn. Poor sample efficiency, consequently, results in agents that are unable to pass bottleneck states, where they are unable to proceed because they do not see the right action sequence to pass the bottleneck enough times to be sufficiently reinforced. Building on prior work using knowledge graphs in reinforcement learning, we introduce two new game state exploration strategies. We compare our exploration strategies against strong baselines on the classic text-adventure game, Zork1, where prior agent have been unable to get past a bottleneck where the agent is eaten by a Grue. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08795">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization</h3><h4>Andrew Gordon Wilson, Pavel Izmailov</h4> Abstract: The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization, rather than using a single setting of weights. Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without significant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to fit images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. Finally, we provide a Bayesian perspective on tempering for calibrating predictive distributions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08791">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Dynamic Federated Learning</h3><h4>Elsa Rizk, Stefan Vlaski, Ali H. Sayed</h4> Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an umbrella term for centralized coordination strategies in multi-agent environments. While many federated learning architectures process data in an online manner, and are hence adaptive by nature, most performance analyses assume static optimization problems and offer no guarantees in the presence of drifts in the problem solution or data characteristics. We consider a federated learning model where at every iteration, a random subset of available agents perform local updates based on their data. Under a non-stationary random walk model on the true minimizer for the aggregate optimization problem, we establish that the performance of the architecture is determined by three factors, namely, the data variability at each agent, the model variability across all agents, and a tracking term that is inversely proportional to the learning rate of the algorithm. The results clarify the trade-off between convergence and tracking performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08782">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Set2Graph: Learning Graphs From Sets</h3><h4>Hadar Serviansky, Nimrod Segol, Jonathan Shlomi, Kyle Cranmer, Eilam Gross, Haggai Maron, Yaron Lipman</h4> Abstract: Many problems in machine learning (ML) can be cast as learning functions from sets to graphs, or more generally to hypergraphs; in short, Set2Graph functions. Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning triplet data in a collection. Current neural network models that approximate Set2Graph functions come from two main ML sub-fields: equivariant learning, and similarity learning. Equivariant models would be in general computationally challenging or even infeasible, while similarity learning models can be shown to have limited expressive power. In this paper we suggest a neural network model family for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets. Testing our models on different machine learning tasks, including an application to particle physics, we find them favorable to existing baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08772">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 19	Towards Certifiable Adversarial Sample Detection</h3><h4>Ilia Shumailov, Yiren Zhao, Robert Mullins, Ross Anderson</h4> Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deployed in more and more classification systems, but adversarial samples can be maliciously crafted to trick them, and are becoming a real threat. There have been various proposals to improve CNNs' adversarial robustness but these all suffer performance penalties or other limitations. In this paper, we provide a new approach in the form of a certifiable adversarial detection scheme, the Certifiable Taboo Trap (CTT). The system can provide certifiable guarantees of detection of adversarial inputs for certain $l_{\infty}$ sizes on a reasonable assumption, namely that the training data have the same distribution as the test data. We develop and evaluate several versions of CTT with a range of defense capabilities, training overheads and certifiability on adversarial samples. Against adversaries with various $l_p$ norms, CTT outperforms existing defense methods that focus purely on improving network robustness. We show that CTT has small false positive rates on clean test data, minimal compute overheads when deployed, and can support complex security policies. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08740">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Bimodal Distribution Removal and Genetic Algorithm in Neural Network for  Breast Cancer Diagnosis</h3><h4>Ke Quan</h4> Abstract: Diagnosis of breast cancer has been well studied in the past. Multiple linear programming models have been devised to approximate the relationship between cell features and tumour malignancy. However, these models are less capable in handling non-linear correlations. Neural networks instead are powerful in processing complex non-linear correlations. It is thus certainly beneficial to approach this cancer diagnosis problem with a model based on neural network. Particularly, introducing bias to neural network training process is deemed as an important means to increase training efficiency. Out of a number of popular proposed methods for introducing artificial bias, Bimodal Distribution Removal (BDR) presents ideal efficiency improvement results and fair simplicity in implementation. However, this paper examines the effectiveness of BDR against the target cancer diagnosis classification problem and shows that BDR process in fact negatively impacts classification performance. In addition, this paper also explores genetic algorithm as an efficient tool for feature selection and produced significantly better results comparing to baseline model that without any feature selection in place <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08729">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Do We Need Zero Training Loss After Achieving Zero Training Error?</h3><h4>Takashi Ishida, Ikko Yamane, Tomoya Sakai, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama</h4> Abstract: Overparameterized deep networks have the capacity to memorize training data with zero training error. Even after memorization, the training loss continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, they often fail to maintain a moderate level of training loss, ending up with a too small or too large loss. We propose a direct solution called flooding that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the flooding level. Our approach makes the loss float around the flooding level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flooding level. This can be implemented with one line of code, and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers. With flooding, the model will continue to "random walk" with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization. We experimentally show that flooding improves performance and as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08709">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	Performance Aware Convolutional Neural Network Channel Pruning for  Embedded GPUs</h3><h4>Valentin Radu, Kuba Kaszyk, Yuan Wen, Jack Turner, Jose Cano, Elliot J. Crowley, Bjorn Franke, Amos Storkey, Michael O'Boyle</h4> Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are becoming a common presence in many applications and services, due to their superior recognition accuracy. They are increasingly being used on mobile devices, many times just by porting large models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes, making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer, based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2x slowdown. On the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves the intended results, with performance speedups of 3x with cuDNN and above 10x with Arm Compute Library and TVM. Our findings expose the need for hardware-instructed neural network pruning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08697">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Stochastic Optimization for Regularized Wasserstein Estimators</h3><h4>Marin Ballu, Quentin Berthet, Francis Bach</h4> Abstract: Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects. Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down first-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08695">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Unsupervised Multi-Class Domain Adaptation: Theory, Algorithms, and  Practice</h3><h4>Yabin Zhang, Bin Deng, Hui Tang, Lei Zhang, Kui Jia</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we study the formalism of unsupervised multi-class domain adaptation (multi-class UDA), which underlies some recent algorithms whose learning objectives are only motivated empirically. A Multi-Class Scoring Disagreement (MCSD) divergence is presented by aggregating the absolute margin violations in multi-class classification; the proposed MCSD is able to fully characterize the relations between any pair of multi-class scoring hypotheses. By using MCSD as a measure of domain distance, we develop a new domain adaptation bound for multi-class UDA as well as its data-dependent, probably approximately correct bound, which naturally suggest adversarial learning objectives to align conditional feature distributions across the source and target domains. Consequently, an algorithmic framework of Multi-class Domain-adversarial learning Networks (McDalNets) is developed, whose different instantiations via surrogate learning objectives either coincide with or resemble a few of recently popular methods, thus (partially) underscoring their practical effectiveness. Based on our same theory of multi-class UDA, we also introduce a new algorithm of Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymmNets), which is featured by a novel adversarial strategy of domain confusion and discrimination. SymmNets afford simple extensions that work equally well under the problem settings of either closed set, partial, or open set UDA. We conduct careful empirical studies to compare different algorithms of McDalNets and our newly introduced SymmNets. Experiments verify our theoretical analysis and show the efficacy of our proposed SymmNets. We make our implementation codes publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08681">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Learning with Differentiable Perturbed Optimizers</h3><h4>Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel, Olivier Teboul, Marco Cuturi, Jean-Philippe Vert, Francis Bach</h4> Abstract: Machine learning pipelines often rely on optimization procedures to make discrete decisions (e.g. sorting, picking closest neighbors, finding shortest paths or optimal matchings). Although these discrete decisions are easily computed in a forward manner, they cannot be used to modify model parameters using first-order optimization techniques because they break the back-propagation of computational graphs. In order to expand the scope of learning problems that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a systematic method to transform a block that outputs an optimal discrete decision into a differentiable operation. Our approach relies on stochastic perturbations of these parameters, and can be used readily within existing solvers without the need for ad hoc regularization or smoothing. These perturbed optimizers yield solutions that are differentiable and never locally constant. The amount of smoothness can be tuned via the chosen noise amplitude, whose impact we analyze. The derivatives of these perturbed solvers can be evaluated efficiently. We also show how this framework can be connected to a family of losses developed in structured prediction, and describe how these can be used in unsupervised and supervised learning, with theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on several machine learning tasks in experiments on synthetic and real data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08676">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Discriminative Manifold Embedding and  Alignment</h3><h4>You-Wei Luo, Chuan-Xian Ren, Pengfei Ge, Ke-Kun Huang, Yu-Feng Yu</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation is effective in leveraging the rich information from the source domain to the unsupervised target domain. Though deep learning and adversarial strategy make an important breakthrough in the adaptability of features, there are two issues to be further explored. First, the hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are risky to the intrinsic data structure. Second, the batch-wise training manner in deep learning limits the description of the global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold learning framework is proposed to achieve transferability and discriminability consistently. As to the first problem, this method establishes a probabilistic discriminant criterion on the target domain via soft labels. Further, this criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second issue; such approximation is also memory-saving. The manifold metric alignment is exploited to be compatible with the embedding space. A theoretical error bound is derived to facilitate the alignment. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the proposal and results of the comparison study manifest the superiority of consistent manifold learning framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08675">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Computationally Tractable Riemannian Manifolds for Graph Embeddings</h3><h4>Calin Cruceru, Gary B√©cigneul, Octavian-Eugen Ganea</h4> Abstract: Representing graphs as sets of node embeddings in certain curved Riemannian manifolds has recently gained momentum in machine learning due to their desirable geometric inductive biases, e.g., hierarchical structures benefit from hyperbolic geometry. However, going beyond embedding spaces of constant sectional curvature, while potentially more representationally powerful, proves to be challenging as one can easily lose the appeal of computationally tractable tools such as geodesic distances or Riemannian gradients. Here, we explore computationally efficient matrix manifolds, showcasing how to learn and optimize graph embeddings in these Riemannian spaces. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over Euclidean geometry while often outperforming hyperbolic and elliptical embeddings based on various metrics that capture different graph properties. Our results serve as new evidence for the benefits of non-Euclidean embeddings in machine learning pipelines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08665">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Adaptive Graph Auto-Encoder for General Data Clustering</h3><h4>Xuelong Li, Hongyuan Zhang, Rui Zhang</h4> Abstract: Graph based clustering plays an important role in clustering area. Recent studies about graph convolution neural networks have achieved impressive success on graph type data. However, in traditional clustering tasks, the graph structure of data does not exist such that the strategy to construct graph is crucial for performance. In addition, the existing graph auto-encoder based approaches perform poorly on weighted graph, which is widely used in graph based clustering. In this paper, we propose a graph auto-encoder with local structure preserving for general data clustering, which can update the constructed graph adaptively. The adaptive process is designed to utilize the non-Euclidean structure sufficiently. By combining generative model for graph embedding and graph based clustering, a graph auto-encoder with a novel decoder is developed and it performs well in weighted graph used scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08648">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Uncovering Coresets for Classification With Multi-Objective Evolutionary  Algorithms</h3><h4>Pietro Barbiero, Giovanni Squillero, Alberto Tonda</h4> Abstract: A coreset is a subset of the training set, using which a machine learning algorithm obtains performances similar to what it would deliver if trained over the whole original data. Coreset discovery is an active and open line of research as it allows improving training speed for the algorithms and may help human understanding the results. Building on previous works, a novel approach is presented: candidate corsets are iteratively optimized, adding and removing samples. As there is an obvious trade-off between limiting training size and quality of the results, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to minimize simultaneously the number of points in the set and the classification error. Experimental results on non-trivial benchmarks show that the proposed approach is able to deliver results that allow a classifier to obtain lower error and better ability of generalizing on unseen data than state-of-the-art coreset discovery techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08645">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder with Joint Clustering via Adjacency Sharing</h3><h4>Xuelong Li, Hongyuan Zhang, Rui Zhang</h4> Abstract: Graph convolution networks have attracted many attentions and several graph auto-encoder based clustering models are developed for attributed graph clustering. However, most existing approaches separate clustering and optimization of graph auto-encoder into two individual steps. In this paper, we propose a graph convolution network based clustering model, namely, Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder with JOint Clustering via Adjacency Sharing (\textit{EGAE-JOCAS}). As for the embedded model, we develop a novel joint clustering method, which combines relaxed k-means and spectral clustering and is applicable for the learned embedding. The proposed joint clustering shares the same adjacency within graph convolution layers. Two parts are optimized simultaneously through performing SGD and taking close-form solutions alternatively to ensure a rapid convergence. Moreover, our model is free to incorporate any mechanisms (e.g., attention) into graph auto-encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of EGAE-JOCAS. Sufficient theoretical analyses are provided to support the results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08643">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	A Novel Framework for Selection of GANs for an Application</h3><h4>Tanya Motwani, Manojkumar Parmar</h4> Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a current focal point of research. The body of knowledge is fragmented, leading to a trial-error method while selecting an appropriate GAN for a given scenario. We provide a comprehensive summary of the evolution of GANs starting from its inception addressing issues like mode collapse, vanishing gradient, unstable training and non-convergence. We also provide a comparison of various GANs from the application point of view, its behaviour and implementation details. We propose a novel framework to identify candidate GANs for a specific use case based on architecture, loss, regularization and divergence. We also discuss application of the framework using an example, and we demonstrate a significant reduction in search space. This efficient way to determine potential GANs lowers unit economics of AI development for organizations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08641">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	The Benefits of Pairwise Discriminators for Adversarial Training</h3><h4>Shangyuan Tong, Timur Garipov, Tommi Jaakkola</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training methods typically align distributions by solving two-player games. However, in most current formulations, even if the generator aligns perfectly with data, a sub-optimal discriminator can still drive the two apart. Absent additional regularization, the instability can manifest itself as a never-ending game. In this paper, we introduce a family of objectives by leveraging pairwise discriminators, and show that only the generator needs to converge. The alignment, if achieved, would be preserved with any discriminator. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence; characterize the capacity balance that should guide the discriminator and generator choices; and construct examples of minimally sufficient discriminators. Empirically, we illustrate the theory and the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic examples. Moreover, we show that practical methods derived from our approach can better generate higher-resolution images. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08621">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Boosting Adversarial Training with Hypersphere Embedding</h3><h4>Tianyu Pang, Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Kun Xu, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective defenses to improve the adversarial robustness of deep learning models. In order to promote the reliability of the adversarially trained models, we propose to boost AT via incorporating hypersphere embedding (HE), which can regularize the adversarial features onto compact hypersphere manifolds. We formally demonstrate that AT and HE are well coupled, which tunes up the learning dynamics of AT from several aspects. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness and universality of HE by embedding it into the popular AT frameworks including PGD-AT, ALP, and TRADES, as well as the FreeAT and FastAT strategies. In experiments, we evaluate our methods on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and verify that integrating HE can consistently enhance the performance of the models trained by each AT framework with little extra computation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08619">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Diversity sampling is an implicit regularization for kernel methods</h3><h4>Micha√´l Fanuel, Joachim Schreurs, Johan A.K. Suykens</h4> Abstract: Kernel methods have achieved very good performance on large scale regression and classification problems, by using the Nystr\"om method and preconditioning techniques. The Nystr\"om approximation -- based on a subset of landmarks -- gives a low rank approximation of the kernel matrix, and is known to provide a form of implicit regularization. We further elaborate on the impact of sampling diverse landmarks for constructing the Nystr\"om approximation in supervised as well as unsupervised kernel methods. By using Determinantal Point Processes for sampling, we obtain additional theoretical results concerning the interplay between diversity and regularization. Empirically, we demonstrate the advantages of training kernel methods based on subsets made of diverse points. In particular, if the dataset has a dense bulk and a sparser tail, we show that Nystr\"om kernel regression with diverse landmarks increases the accuracy of the regression in sparser regions of the dataset, with respect to a uniform landmark sampling. A greedy heuristic is also proposed to select diverse samples of significant size within large datasets when exact DPP sampling is not practically feasible. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08616">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Optimizing Black-box Metrics with Adaptive Surrogates</h3><h4>Qijia Jiang, Olaoluwa Adigun, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Mahdi Milani Fard, Maya Gupta</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of training models with black-box and hard-to-optimize metrics by expressing the metric as a monotonic function of a small number of easy-to-optimize surrogates. We pose the training problem as an optimization over a relaxed surrogate space, which we solve by estimating local gradients for the metric and performing inexact convex projections. We analyze gradient estimates based on finite differences and local linear interpolations, and show convergence of our approach under smoothness assumptions with respect to the surrogates. Experimental results on classification and ranking problems verify the proposal performs on par with methods that know the mathematical formulation, and adds notable value when the form of the metric is unknown. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08605">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements</h3><h4>Haggai Maron, Or Litany, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya</h4> Abstract: Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, which is attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to certain symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08599">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	Interpretability of machine learning based prediction models in  healthcare</h3><h4>Gregor Stiglic, Primoz Kocbek, Nino Fijacko, Marinka Zitnik, Katrien Verbert, Leona Cilar</h4> Abstract: There is a need of ensuring machine learning models that are interpretable. Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08596">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	Regret Minimization in Stochastic Contextual Dueling Bandits</h3><h4>Aadirupa Saha, Aditya Gopalan</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of stochastic $K$-armed dueling bandit in the contextual setting, where at each round the learner is presented with a context set of $K$ items, each represented by a $d$-dimensional feature vector, and the goal of the learner is to identify the best arm of each context sets. However, unlike the classical contextual bandit setup, our framework only allows the learner to receive item feedback in terms of their (noisy) pariwise preferences--famously studied as dueling bandits which is practical interests in various online decision making scenarios, e.g. recommender systems, information retrieval, tournament ranking, where it is easier to elicit the relative strength of the items instead of their absolute scores. However, to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to consider the problem of regret minimization of contextual dueling bandits for potentially infinite decision spaces and gives provably optimal algorithms along with a matching lower bound analysis. We present two algorithms for the setup with respective regret guarantees $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT \log K})$. Subsequently we also show that $\Omega(\sqrt {dT})$ is actually the fundamental performance limit for this problem, implying the optimality of our second algorithm. However the analysis of our first algorithm is comparatively simpler, and it is often shown to outperform the former empirically. Finally, we corroborate all the theoretical results with suitable experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08583">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Differentially Private ERM Based on Data Perturbation</h3><h4>Yilin Kang, Yong Liu, Lizhong Ding, Xinwang Liu, Xinyi Tong, Weiping Wang</h4> Abstract: In this paper, after observing that different training data instances affect the machine learning model to different extents, we attempt to improve the performance of differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM) from a new perspective. Specifically, we measure the contributions of various training data instances on the final machine learning model, and select some of them to add random noise. Considering that the key of our method is to measure each data instance separately, we propose a new `Data perturbation' based (DB) paradigm for DP-ERM: adding random noise to the original training data and achieving ($\epsilon,\delta$)-differential privacy on the final machine learning model, along with the preservation on the original data. By introducing the Influence Function (IF), we quantitatively measure the impact of the training data on the final model. Theoretical and experimental results show that our proposed DBDP-ERM paradigm enhances the model performance significantly. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08578">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Input Perturbation: A New Paradigm between Central and Local  Differential Privacy</h3><h4>Yilin Kang, Yong Liu, Ben Niu, Xinyi Tong, Likun Zhang, Weiping Wang</h4> Abstract: Traditionally, there are two models on differential privacy: the central model and the local model. The central model focuses on the machine learning model and the local model focuses on the training data. In this paper, we study the \textit{input perturbation} method in differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM), preserving privacy of the central model. By adding noise to the original training data and training with the `perturbed data', we achieve ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differential privacy on the final model, along with some kind of privacy on the original data. We observe that there is an interesting connection between the local model and the central model: the perturbation on the original data causes the perturbation on the gradient, and finally the model parameters. This observation means that our method builds a bridge between local and central model, protecting the data, the gradient and the model simultaneously, which is more superior than previous central methods. Detailed theoretical analysis and experiments show that our method achieves almost the same (or even better) performance as some of the best previous central methods with more protections on privacy, which is an attractive result. Moreover, we extend our method to a more general case: the loss function satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is more general than strong convexity, the constraint on the loss function in most previous work. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08570">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	Towards Byzantine-resilient Learning in Decentralized Systems</h3><h4>Shangwei Guo, Tianwei Zhang, Xiaofei Xie, Lei Ma, Tao Xiang, Yang Liu</h4> Abstract: With the proliferation of IoT and edge computing, decentralized learning is becoming more promising. When designing a distributed learning system, one major challenge to consider is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). Past works have researched Byzantine-resilient solutions for centralized distributed learning. However, there are currently no satisfactory solutions with strong efficiency and security in decentralized systems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Mozi, to achieve BFT in decentralized learning systems. Specifically, Mozi provides a uniform Byzantine-resilient aggregation rule for benign nodes to select the useful parameter updates and filter out the malicious ones in each training iteration. It guarantees that each benign node in a decentralized system can train a correct model under very strong Byzantine attacks with an arbitrary number of faulty nodes. We perform the theoretical analysis to prove the uniform convergence of our proposed algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the high security and efficiency of Mozi compared to all existing solutions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08569">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Self-Powered and Sustainable  Edge Computing Systems</h3><h4>Md. Shirajum Munir, Nguyen H. Tran, Walid Saad, Choong Seon Hong</h4> Abstract: The stringent requirements of mobile edge computing (MEC) applications and functions fathom the high capacity and dense deployment of MEC hosts to the upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a BS unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this paper, an effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic, asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the energy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08567">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	Non-asymptotic and Accurate Learning of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</h3><h4>Yahya Sattar, Samet Oymak</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stabilizable systems governed by nonlinear state equation $h_{t+1}=\phi(h_t,u_t;\theta)+w_t$. Here $\theta$ is the unknown system dynamics, $h_t $ is the state, $u_t$ is the input and $w_t$ is the additive noise vector. We study gradient based algorithms to learn the system dynamics $\theta$ from samples obtained from a single finite trajectory. If the system is run by a stabilizing input policy, we show that temporally-dependent samples can be approximated by i.i.d. samples via a truncation argument by using mixing-time arguments. We then develop new guarantees for the uniform convergence of the gradients of empirical loss. Unlike existing work, our bounds are noise sensitive which allows for learning ground-truth dynamics with high accuracy and small sample complexity. Together, our results facilitate efficient learning of the general nonlinear system under stabilizing policy. We specialize our guarantees to entry-wise nonlinear activations and verify our theory in various numerical experiments <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Safe Counterfactual Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Yusuke Narita, Shota Yasui, Kohei Yata</h4> Abstract: We develop a method for predicting the performance of reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms, given historical data that may have been generated by a different algorithm. Our estimator has the property that its prediction converges in probability to the true performance of a counterfactual algorithm at the fast $\sqrt{N}$ rate, as the sample size $N$ increases. We also show a correct way to estimate the variance of our prediction, thus allowing the analyst to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. These properties hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of potentially important state variables are really important. These theoretical guarantees make our estimator safe to use. We finally apply it to improve advertisement design by a major advertisement company. We find that our method produces smaller mean squared errors than state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08536">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Adaptive Sampling Distributed Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient for  Heterogeneous Distributed Datasets</h3><h4>Ilqar Ramazanli, Han Nguyen, Hai Pham, Sashank Reddi, Barnabas Poczos</h4> Abstract: We study distributed optimization algorithms for minimizing the average of \emph{heterogeneous} functions distributed across several machines with a focus on communication efficiency. In such settings, naively using the classical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants (e.g., SVRG) with a uniform sampling of machines typically yields poor performance. It often leads to the dependence of convergence rate on maximum Lipschitz constant of gradients across the devices. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{adaptive} sampling of machines specially catered to these settings. Our method relies on an adaptive estimate of local Lipschitz constants base on the information of past gradients. We show that the new way improves the dependence of convergence rate from maximum Lipschitz constant to \emph{average} Lipschitz constant across machines, thereby, significantly accelerating the convergence. Our experiments demonstrate that our method indeed speeds up the convergence of the standard SVRG algorithm in heterogeneous environments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08528">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	NAttack! Adversarial Attacks to bypass a GAN based classifier trained to  detect Network intrusion</h3><h4>Aritran Piplai, Sai Sree Laya Chukkapalli, Anupam Joshi</h4> Abstract: With the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, anomalies in network traffic can be detected using machine learning approaches. Before the rise of machine learning, network anomalies which could imply an attack, were detected using well-crafted rules. An attacker who has knowledge in the field of cyber-defence could make educated guesses to sometimes accurately predict which particular features of network traffic data the cyber-defence mechanism is looking at. With this information, the attacker can circumvent a rule-based cyber-defense system. However, after the advancements of machine learning for network anomaly, it is not easy for a human to understand how to bypass a cyber-defence system. Recently, adversarial attacks have become increasingly common to defeat machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we show that even if we build a classifier and train it with adversarial examples for network data, we can use adversarial attacks and successfully break the system. We propose a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)based algorithm to generate data to train an efficient neural network based classifier, and we subsequently break the system using adversarial attacks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08527">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization</h3><h4>David Eriksson, Matthias Poloczek</h4> Abstract: The global optimization of a high-dimensional black-box function under black-box constraints is a pervasive task in machine learning, control, and engineering. These problems are difficult since the feasible set is typically non-convex and hard to find, in addition to the curses of dimensionality and the heterogeneity of the underlying functions. In particular, these characteristics dramatically impact the performance of Bayesian optimization methods, that otherwise have become the de-facto standard for sample-efficient optimization in unconstrained settings. Due to the lack of sample-efficient methods, practitioners usually fall back to evolutionary strategies or heuristics. We propose the scalable constrained Bayesian optimization (SCBO) algorithm that addresses the above challenges by data-independent transformations of the functions and follows the recent theme of local Bayesian optimization. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SCBO achieves excellent results and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08526">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	Avoiding Kernel Fixed Points: Computing with ELU and GELU Infinite  Networks</h3><h4>Russell Tsuchida, Tim Pearce, Christopher Van Der Heide, Fred Roosta, Marcus Gallagher</h4> Abstract: Analysing and computing with Gaussian processes arising from infinitely wide neural networks has recently seen a resurgence in popularity. Despite this, many explicit covariance functions of networks with activation functions used in modern networks remain unknown. Furthermore, while the kernels of deep networks can be computed iteratively, theoretical understanding of deep kernels is lacking, particularly with respect to fixed-point dynamics. Firstly, we derive the covariance functions of MLPs with exponential linear units and Gaussian error linear units and evaluate the performance of the limiting Gaussian processes on some benchmarks. Secondly, and more generally, we introduce a framework for analysing the fixed-point dynamics of iterated kernels corresponding to a broad range of activation functions. We find that unlike some previously studied neural network kernels, these new kernels exhibit non-trivial fixed-point dynamics which are mirrored in finite-width neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08517">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 49	Estimating Training Data Influence by Tracking Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Garima Pruthi, Frederick Liu, Mukund Sundararajan, Satyen Kale</h4> Abstract: We introduce a method called TrackIn that computes the influence of a training example on a prediction made by the model, by tracking how the loss on the test point changes during the training process whenever the training example of interest was utilized. We provide a scalable implementation of TrackIn via a combination of a few key ideas: (a) a first-order approximation to the exact computation, (b) using random projections to speed up the computation of the first-order approximation for large models, (c) using saved checkpoints of standard training procedures, and (d) cherry-picking layers of a deep neural network. An experimental evaluation shows that TrackIn is more effective in identifying mislabelled training examples than other related methods such as influence functions and representer points. We also discuss insights from applying the method on vision, regression and natural language tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08484">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 50	Strength from Weakness: Fast Learning Using Weak Supervision</h3><h4>Joshua Robinson, Stefanie Jegelka, Suvrit Sra</h4> Abstract: We study generalization properties of weakly supervised learning. That is, learning where only a few "strong" labels (the actual target of our prediction) are present but many more "weak" labels are available. In particular, we show that having access to weak labels can significantly accelerate the learning rate for the strong task to the fast rate of $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac1n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of strongly labeled data points. This acceleration can happen even if by itself the strongly labeled data admits only the slower $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ rate. The actual acceleration depends continuously on the number of weak labels available, and on the relation between the two tasks. Our theoretical results are reflected empirically across a range of tasks and illustrate how weak labels speed up learning on the strong task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08483">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 51	AdvMS: A Multi-source Multi-cost Defense Against Adversarial Attacks</h3><h4>Xiao Wang, Siyue Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xue Lin, Peter Chin</h4> Abstract: Designing effective defense against adversarial attacks is a crucial topic as deep neural networks have been proliferated rapidly in many security-critical domains such as malware detection and self-driving cars. Conventional defense methods, although shown to be promising, are largely limited by their single-source single-cost nature: The robustness promotion tends to plateau when the defenses are made increasingly stronger while the cost tends to amplify. In this paper, we study principles of designing multi-source and multi-cost schemes where defense performance is boosted from multiple defending components. Based on this motivation, we propose a multi-source and multi-cost defense scheme, Adversarially Trained Model Switching (AdvMS), that inherits advantages from two leading schemes: adversarial training and random model switching. We show that the multi-source nature of AdvMS mitigates the performance plateauing issue and the multi-cost nature enables improving robustness at a flexible and adjustable combination of costs over different factors which can better suit specific restrictions and needs in practice. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08439">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 52	PrivacyFL: A simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated  learning</h3><h4>Vaikkunth Mugunthan, Anton Peraire-Bueno, Lalana Kagal</h4> Abstract: Federated learning is a technique that enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model while keeping their training data localized. This reduces data privacy risks, however, privacy concerns still exist since it is possible to leak information about the training dataset from the trained model's weights or parameters. Setting up a federated learning environment, especially with security and privacy guarantees, is a time-consuming process with numerous configurations and parameters that can be manipulated. In order to help clients ensure that collaboration is feasible and to check that it improves their model accuracy, a real-world simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated learning is required. In this paper, we introduce PrivacyFL, which is an extensible, easily configurable and scalable simulator for federated learning environments. Its key features include latency simulation, robustness to client departure, support for both centralized and decentralized learning, and configurable privacy and security mechanisms based on differential privacy and secure multiparty computation. In this paper, we motivate our research, describe the architecture of the simulator and associated protocols, and discuss its evaluation in numerous scenarios that highlight its wide range of functionality and its advantages. Our paper addresses a significant real-world problem: checking the feasibility of participating in a federated learning environment under a variety of circumstances. It also has a strong practical impact because organizations such as hospitals, banks, and research institutes, which have large amounts of sensitive data and would like to collaborate, would greatly benefit from having a system that enables them to do so in a privacy-preserving and secure manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08423">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 53	Warm Starting Bandits with Side Information from Confounded Data</h3><h4>Nihal Sharma, Soumya Basu, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Sanjay Shakkottai</h4> Abstract: We study a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem where side information in the form of bounds on the mean of each arm is provided. We describe how these bounds on the means can be used efficiently for warm starting bandits. Specifically, we propose the novel UCB-SI algorithm, and illustrate improvements in cumulative regret over the standard UCB algorithm, both theoretically and empirically, in the presence of non-trivial side information. As noted in (Zhang & Bareinboim, 2017), such information arises, for instance, when we have prior logged data on the arms, but this data has been collected under a policy whose choice of arms is based on latent variables to which access is no longer available. We further provide a novel approach for obtaining such bounds from prior partially confounded data under some mild assumptions. We validate our findings through semi-synthetic experiments on data derived from real datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08405">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 54	Keep Doing What Worked: Behavioral Modelling Priors for Offline  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Noah Y. Siegel, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Felix Berkenkamp, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Michael Neunert, Thomas Lampe, Roland Hafner, Martin Riedmiller</h4> Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -- the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -- to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources. We find improvements on competitive baselines in a variety of RL tasks -- including standard continuous control benchmarks and multi-task learning for simulated and real-world robots. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08396">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 55	Predicting Many Properties of a Quantum System from Very Few  Measurements</h3><h4>Hsin-Yuan Huang, Richard Kueng, John Preskill</h4> Abstract: Predicting properties of complex, large-scale quantum systems is essential for developing quantum technologies. We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a classical shadow, can be used to predict many different properties: order $\log M$ measurements suffice to accurately predict $M$ different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size, and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables, and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians, which allows applications to speedup variational quantum algorithms. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08953">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 56	I-SPEC: An End-to-End Framework for Learning Transportable, Shift-Stable  Models</h3><h4>Adarsh Subbaswamy, Suchi Saria</h4> Abstract: Shifts in environment between development and deployment cause classical supervised learning to produce models that fail to generalize well to new target distributions. Recently, many solutions which find invariant predictive distributions have been developed. Among these, graph-based approaches do not require data from the target environment and can capture more stable information than alternative methods which find stable feature sets. However, these approaches assume that the data generating process is known in the form of a full causal graph, which is generally not the case. In this paper, we propose I-SPEC, an end-to-end framework that addresses this shortcoming by using data to learn a partial ancestral graph (PAG). Using the PAG we develop an algorithm that determines an interventional distribution that is stable to the declared shifts; this subsumes existing approaches which find stable feature sets that are less accurate. We apply I-SPEC to a mortality prediction problem to show it can learn a model that is robust to shifts without needing upfront knowledge of the full causal DAG. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08948">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 57	Implicit differentiation of Lasso-type models for hyperparameter  optimization</h3><h4>Quentin Bertrand, Quentin Klopfenstein, Mathieu Blondel, Samuel Vaiter, Alexandre Gramfort, Joseph Salmon</h4> Abstract: Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously difficult, though crucial in practice. The most popular hyperparameter optimization approach is grid-search using held-out validation data. Grid-search however requires to choose a predefined grid for each parameter, which scales exponentially in the number of parameters. Another approach is to cast hyperparameter optimization as a bi-level optimization problem, one can solve by gradient descent. The key challenge for these methods is the estimation of the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. Computing this gradient via forward or backward automatic differentiation is possible yet usually suffers from high memory consumption. Alternatively implicit differentiation typically involves solving a linear system which can be prohibitive and numerically unstable in high dimension. In addition, implicit differentiation usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the case for Lasso-type problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation algorithm, without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our approach scales to high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods to optimize the error on held-out data, or the Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08943">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 58	Wavesplit: End-to-End Speech Separation by Speaker Clustering</h3><h4>Neil Zeghidour, David Grangier</h4> Abstract: We introduce Wavesplit, an end-to-end speech separation system. From a single recording of mixed speech, the model infers and clusters representations of each speaker and then estimates each source signal conditioned on the inferred representations. The model is trained on the raw waveform to jointly perform the two tasks. Our model infers a set of speaker representations through clustering, which addresses the fundamental permutation problem of speech separation. Moreover, the sequence-wide speaker representations provide a more robust separation of long, challenging sequences, compared to previous approaches. We show that Wavesplit outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on clean mixtures of 2 or 3 speakers (WSJ0-2mix, WSJ0-3mix), as well as in noisy (WHAM!) and reverberated (WHAMR!) conditions. As an additional contribution, we further improve our model by introducing online data augmentation for separation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08933">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 59	Imputer: Sequence Modelling via Imputation and Dynamic Programming</h3><h4>William Chan, Chitwan Saharia, Geoffrey Hinton, Mohammad Norouzi, Navdeep Jaitly</h4> Abstract: This paper presents the Imputer, a neural sequence model that generates output sequences iteratively via imputations. The Imputer is an iterative generative model, requiring only a constant number of generation steps independent of the number of input or output tokens. The Imputer can be trained to approximately marginalize over all possible alignments between the input and output sequences, and all possible generation orders. We present a tractable dynamic programming training algorithm, which yields a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. When applied to end-to-end speech recognition, the Imputer outperforms prior non-autoregressive models and achieves competitive results to autoregressive models. On LibriSpeech test-other, the Imputer achieves 11.1 WER, outperforming CTC at 13.0 WER and seq2seq at 12.5 WER. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08926">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 60	How Much Knowledge Can You Pack Into the Parameters of a Language Model?</h3><h4>Adam Roberts, Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer</h4> Abstract: It has recently been observed that neural language models trained on unstructured text can implicitly store and retrieve knowledge using natural language queries. In this short paper, we measure the practical utility of this approach by fine-tuning pre-trained models to answer questions without access to any external context or knowledge. We show that this approach scales surprisingly well with model size and outperforms models that explicitly look up knowledge on the open-domain variants of Natural Questions and WebQuestions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08910">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 61	REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training</h3><h4>Kelvin Guu, Kenton Lee, Zora Tung, Panupong Pasupat, Ming-Wei Chang</h4> Abstract: Language model pre-training has been shown to capture a surprising amount of world knowledge, crucial for NLP tasks such as question answering. However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08909">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 62	Second-order Conditional Gradients</h3><h4>Alejandro Carderera, Sebastian Pokutta</h4> Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to the quadratic convergence rates these methods enjoy when close to the optimum. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. In the case where the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information about the function, although possible, is costly, the coupling of constrained second-order and conditional gradient algorithms leads to competitive algorithms with solid theoretical guarantees and good numerical performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08907">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 63	Application of Pre-training Models in Named Entity Recognition</h3><h4>Yu Wang, Yining Sun, Zuchang Ma, Lisheng Gao, Yang Xu, Ting Sun</h4> Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to extract entities from unstructured data. The previous methods for NER were based on machine learning or deep learning. Recently, pre-training models have significantly improved performance on multiple NLP tasks. In this paper, firstly, we introduce the architecture and pre-training tasks of four common pre-training models: BERT, ERNIE, ERNIE2.0-tiny, and RoBERTa. Then, we apply these pre-training models to a NER task by fine-tuning, and compare the effects of the different model architecture and pre-training tasks on the NER task. The experiment results showed that RoBERTa achieved state-of-the-art results on the MSRA-2006 dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08902">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 64	Identifying physical health comorbidities in a cohort of individuals  with severe mental illness: An application of SemEHR</h3><h4>Rebecca Bendayan, Honghan Wu, Zeljko Kraljevic, Robert Stewart, Tom Searle, Jaya Chaturvedi, Jayati Das-Munshi, Zina Ibrahim, Aurelie Mascio, Angus Roberts, Daniel Bean, Richard Dobson</h4> Abstract: Multimorbidity research in mental health services requires data from physical health conditions which is traditionally limited in mental health care electronic health records. In this study, we aimed to extract data from physical health conditions from clinical notes using SemEHR. Data was extracted from Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system at South London and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) and the cohort consisted of all individuals who had received a primary or secondary diagnosis of severe mental illness between 2007 and 2018. Three pairs of annotators annotated 2403 documents with an average Cohen's Kappa of 0.757. Results show that the NLP performance varies across different diseases areas (F1 0.601 - 0.954) suggesting that the language patterns or terminologies of different condition groups entail different technical challenges to the same NLP task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08901">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 65	SynFi: Automatic Synthetic Fingerprint Generation</h3><h4>M. Sadegh Riazi, Seyed M. Chavoshian, Farinaz Koushanfar</h4> Abstract: Authentication and identification methods based on human fingerprints are ubiquitous in several systems ranging from government organizations to consumer products. The performance and reliability of such systems directly rely on the volume of data on which they have been verified. Unfortunately, a large volume of fingerprint databases is not publicly available due to many privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to automatically generate high-fidelity synthetic fingerprints at scale. Our approach relies on (i) Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate the probability distribution of human fingerprints and (ii) Super-Resolution methods to synthesize fine-grained textures. We rigorously test our system and show that our methodology is the first to generate fingerprints that are computationally indistinguishable from real ones, a task that prior art could not accomplish. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08900">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 66	MA-DST: Multi-Attention Based Scalable Dialog State Tracking</h3><h4>Adarsh Kumar, Peter Ku, Anuj Kumar Goyal, Angeliki Metallinou, Dilek Hakkani-Tur</h4> Abstract: Task oriented dialog agents provide a natural language interface for users to complete their goal. Dialog State Tracking (DST), which is often a core component of these systems, tracks the system's understanding of the user's goal throughout the conversation. To enable accurate multi-domain DST, the model needs to encode dependencies between past utterances and slot semantics and understand the dialog context, including long-range cross-domain references. We introduce a novel architecture for this task to encode the conversation history and slot semantics more robustly by using attention mechanisms at multiple granularities. In particular, we use cross-attention to model relationships between the context and slots at different semantic levels and self-attention to resolve cross-domain coreferences. In addition, our proposed architecture does not rely on knowing the domain ontologies beforehand and can also be used in a zero-shot setting for new domains or unseen slot values. Our model improves the joint goal accuracy by 5% (absolute) in the full-data setting and by up to 2% (absolute) in the zero-shot setting over the present state-of-the-art on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08898">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 67	Reliable Distributed Clustering with Redundant Data Assignment</h3><h4>Venkata Gandikota, Arya Mazumdar, Ankit Singh Rawat</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present distributed generalized clustering algorithms that can handle large scale data across multiple machines in spite of straggling or unreliable machines. We propose a novel data assignment scheme that enables us to obtain global information about the entire data even when some machines fail to respond with the results of the assigned local computations. The assignment scheme leads to distributed algorithms with good approximation guarantees for a variety of clustering and dimensionality reduction problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08892">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 68	Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning as a Computational Tool for Language  Evolution Research: Historical Context and Future Challenges</h3><h4>Cl√©ment Moulin-Frier, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</h4> Abstract: Computational models of emergent communication in agent populations are currently gaining interest in the machine learning community due to recent advances in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Current contributions are however still relatively disconnected from the earlier theoretical and computational literature aiming at understanding how language might have emerged from a prelinguistic substance. The goal of this paper is to position recent MARL contributions within the historical context of language evolution research, as well as to extract from this theoretical and computational background a few challenges for future research. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08878">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 69	Halpern Iteration for Near-Optimal and Parameter-Free Monotone Inclusion  and Strong Solutions to Variational Inequalities</h3><h4>Jelena Diakonikolas</h4> Abstract: We leverage the connections between nonexpansive maps, monotone Lipschitz operators, and proximal mappings to obtain near-optimal (i.e., optimal up to poly-log factors in terms of iteration complexity) and parameter-free methods for solving monotone inclusion problems. These results immediately translate into near-optimal guarantees for approximating strong solutions to variational inequality problems, approximating convex-concave min-max optimization problems, and minimizing the norm of the gradient in min-max optimization problems. Our analysis is based on a novel and simple potential-based proof of convergence of Halpern iteration, a classical iteration for finding fixed points of nonexpansive maps. Additionally, we provide a series of algorithmic reductions that highlight connections between different problem classes and lead to lower bounds that certify near-optimality of the studied methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08872">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 70	Fast Differentiable Sorting and Ranking</h3><h4>Mathieu Blondel, Olivier Teboul, Quentin Berthet, Josip Djolonga</h4> Abstract: The sorting operation is one of the most basic and commonly used building blocks in computer programming. In machine learning, it is commonly used for robust statistics. However, seen as a function, it is piecewise linear and as a result includes many kinks at which it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the related ranking operator, commonly used for order statistics and ranking metrics. It is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one would expect from sorting and ranking operations. In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable sorting and ranking operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase two novel applications: differentiable Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and soft least trimmed squares. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08871">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 71	Contextual Lensing of Universal Sentence Representations</h3><h4>Jamie Kiros</h4> Abstract: What makes a universal sentence encoder universal? The notion of a generic encoder of text appears to be at odds with the inherent contextualization and non-permanence of language use in a dynamic world. However, mapping sentences into generic fixed-length vectors for downstream similarity and retrieval tasks has been fruitful, particularly for multilingual applications. How do we manage this dilemma? In this work we propose Contextual Lensing, a methodology for inducing context-oriented universal sentence vectors. We break the construction of universal sentence vectors into a core, variable length, sentence matrix representation equipped with an adaptable `lens' from which fixed-length vectors can be induced as a function of the lens context. We show that it is possible to focus notions of language similarity into a small number of lens parameters given a core universal matrix representation. For example, we demonstrate the ability to encode translation similarity of sentences across several languages into a single weight matrix, even when the core encoder has not seen parallel data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08866">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 72	Bounding the expected run-time of nonconvex optimization with early  stopping</h3><h4>Thomas Flynn, Kwang Min Yu, Abid Malik, Nicolas D'Imperio, Shinjae Yoo</h4> Abstract: This work examines the convergence of stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithms that use early stopping based on a validation function. The form of early stopping we consider is that optimization terminates when the norm of the gradient of a validation function falls below a threshold. We derive conditions that guarantee this stopping rule is well-defined, and provide bounds on the expected number of iterations and gradient evaluations needed to meet this criterion. The guarantee accounts for the distance between the training and validation sets, measured with the Wasserstein distance. We develop the approach in the general setting of a first-order optimization algorithm, with possibly biased update directions subject to a geometric drift condition. We then derive bounds on the expected running time for early stopping variants of several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decentralized SGD (DSGD), and the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. Finally, we consider the generalization properties of the iterate returned by early stopping. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08856">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 73	A General Pairwise Comparison Model for Extremely Sparse Networks</h3><h4>Ruijian Han, Yiming Xu, Kani Chen</h4> Abstract: Statistical inference using pairwise comparison data has been an effective approach to analyzing complex and sparse networks. In this paper we propose a general framework for modeling the mutual interaction in a probabilistic network, which enjoys ample flexibility in terms of parametrization. Within this set-up, we establish that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the latent scores of the subjects is uniformly consistent under a near-minimal condition on network sparsity. This condition is sharp in terms of the leading order asymptotics describing the sparsity. The proof utilizes a novel chaining technique based on the error-induced metric as well as careful counting of comparison graph structures. Our results guarantee that the MLE is a valid estimator for inference in large-scale comparison networks where data is asymptotically deficient. Numerical simulations are provided to complement the theoretical analysis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08853">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 74	Contextual Reserve Price Optimization in Auctions</h3><h4>Joey Huchette, Haihao Lu, Hossein Esfandiari, Vahab Mirrokni</h4> Abstract: We study the problem of learning a linear model to set the reserve price in order to maximize expected revenue in an auction, given contextual information. First, we show that it is not possible to solve this problem in polynomial time unless the \emph{Exponential Time Hypothesis} fails. Second, we present a strong mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for this problem, which is capable of exactly modeling the nonconvex and discontinuous expected reward function. Moreover, we show that this MIP formulation is ideal (the strongest possible formulation) for the revenue function. Since it can be computationally expensive to exactly solve the MIP formulation, we also study the performance of its linear programming (LP) relaxation. We show that, unfortunately, in the worst case the objective gap of the linear programming relaxation can be $O(n)$ times larger than the optimal objective of the actual problem, where $n$ is the number of samples. Finally, we present computational results, showcasing that the mixed-integer programming formulation, along with its linear programming relaxation, are able to superior both the in-sample performance and the out-of-sample performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms on both real and synthetic datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08841">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 75	PA-Cache: Learning-based Popularity-Aware Content Caching in Edge  Networks</h3><h4>Qilin Fan, Jian Li, Xiuhua Li, Qiang He, Shu Fu, Sen Wang</h4> Abstract: With the aggressive growth of smart environments, a large amount of data are generated by edge devices. As a result, content delivery has been quickly pushed to network edges. Compared with classical content delivery networks, edge caches with smaller size usually suffer from more bursty requests, which makes conventional caching algorithms perform poorly in edge networks. This paper aims to propose an effective caching decision policy called PA-Cache that uses evolving deep learning to adaptively learn time-varying content popularity to decide which content to evict when the cache is full. Unlike prior learning-based approaches that either use a small set of features for decision making or require the entire training dataset to be available for learning a fine-tuned but might outdated prediction model, PA-Cache weights a large set of critical features to train the neural network in an evolving manner so as to meet the edge requests with fluctuations and bursts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PA-Cache through extensive experiments with real-world data traces from a large commercial video-on-demand service provider. The evaluation shows that PA-Cache improves the hit rate in comparison with state-of-the-art methods at a lower computational cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08805">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 76	Guiding attention in Sequence-to-sequence models for Dialogue Act  prediction</h3><h4>Pierre Colombo, Emile Chapuis, Matteo Manica, Emmanuel Vignon, Giovanna Varni, Chloe Clavel</h4> Abstract: The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality. Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to the state of the art our model does not require handcrafted features and is trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on MRDA. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08801">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 77	Pruning untrained neural networks: Principles and Analysis</h3><h4>Soufiane Hayou, Jean-Francois Ton, Arnaud Doucet, Yee Whye Teh</h4> Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks display state-of-the art performance. However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks to be able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning pre-trained neural networks (e.g. LeCun et al. (1990) and Hassabi et al. (1993)), recent work by Lee et al. (2018) showed promising results where pruning is performed at initialization. However, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, these procedures do not prevent one layer being fully pruned. In this paper we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of pruning at initialization and training sparse architectures. This analysis allows us to propose novel principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of network architectures. We particularly show that we can prune up to 99.9% of the weights while keeping the model trainable. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08797">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 78	Do you comply with AI? -- Personalized explanations of learning  algorithms and their impact on employees' compliance behavior</h3><h4>NIklas Kuhl, Jodie Lobana, Christian Meske</h4> Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are technological key enablers for artificial intelligence (AI). Due to the inherent complexity, these learning algorithms represent black boxes and are difficult to comprehend, therefore influencing compliance behavior. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of such artifacts, which can impact employees' task performance significantly, is still subject to research - and personalization of AI explanations seems to be a promising concept in this regard. In our work, we hypothesize that, based on varying backgrounds like training, domain knowledge and demographic characteristics, individuals have different understandings and hence mental models about the learning algorithm. Personalization of AI explanations, related to the individuals' mental models, may thus be an instrument to affect compliance and therefore employee task performance. Our preliminary results already indicate the importance of personalized explanations in industry settings and emphasize the importance of this research endeavor. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08777">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 79	Propose, Test, Release: Differentially private estimation with high  probability</h3><h4>Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, Marco Avella-Medina</h4> Abstract: We derive concentration inequalities for differentially private median and mean estimators building on the "Propose, Test, Release" (PTR) mechanism introduced by Dwork and Lei (2009). We introduce a new general version of the PTR mechanism that allows us to derive high probability error bounds for differentially private estimators. Our algorithms provide the first statistical guarantees for differentially private estimation of the median and mean without any boundedness assumptions on the data, and without assuming that the target population parameter lies in some known bounded interval. Our procedures do not rely on any truncation of the data and provide the first sub-Gaussian high probability bounds for differentially private median and mean estimation, for possibly heavy tailed random variables. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08774">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 80	Object 6D Pose Estimation with Non-local Attention</h3><h4>Jianhan Mei, Henghui Ding, Xudong Jiang</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of estimating 6D object pose from a single RGB image. Motivated by the deep learning based object detection methods, we propose a concise and efficient network that integrate 6D object pose parameter estimation into the object detection framework. Furthermore, for more robust estimation to occlusion, a non-local self-attention module is introduced.

<h3>No. 81	APTER: Aggregated Prognosis Through Exponential Reweighting</h3><h4>Kristiaan Pelckmans, Liu Yang</h4> Abstract: This paper considers the task of learning how to make a prognosis of a patient based on his/her micro-array expression levels. The method is an application of the aggregation method as recently proposed in the literature on theoretical machine learning, and excels in its computational convenience and capability to deal with high-dimensional data. A formal analysis of the method is given, yielding rates of convergence similar to what traditional techniques obtain, while it is shown to cope well with an exponentially large set of features. Those results are supported by numerical simulations on a range of publicly available survival-micro-array datasets. It is empirically found that the proposed technique combined with a recently proposed preprocessing technique gives excellent performances. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08731">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 82	A survey on Semi-, Self- and Unsupervised Techniques in Image  Classification</h3><h4>Lars Schmarje, Monty Santarossa, Simon-Martin Schr√∂der, Reinhard Koch</h4> Abstract: While deep learning strategies achieve outstanding results in computer vision tasks, one issue remains. The current strategies rely heavily on a huge amount of labeled data. In many real-world problems it is not feasible to create such an amount of labeled training data. Therefore, researchers try to incorporate unlabeled data into the training process to reach equal results with fewer labels. Due to a lot of concurrent research, it is difficult to keep track of recent developments. In this survey we provide an overview of often used techniques and methods in image classification with fewer labels. We compare 21 methods. In our analysis we identify three major trends. 1. State-of-the-art methods are scaleable to real world applications based on their accuracy. 2. The degree of supervision which is needed to achieve comparable results to the usage of all labels is decreasing. 3. All methods share common techniques while only few methods combine these techniques to achieve better performance. Based on all of these three trends we discover future research opportunities. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08721">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 83	Automatic Gesture Recognition in Robot-assisted Surgery with  Reinforcement Learning and Tree Search</h3><h4>Xiaojie Gao, Yueming Jin, Qi Dou, Pheng-Ann Heng</h4> Abstract: Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamental for improving intelligence in robot-assisted surgery, such as conducting complicated tasks of surgery surveillance and skill evaluation. However, current methods treat each frame individually and produce the outcomes without effective consideration on future information. In this paper, we propose a framework based on reinforcement learning and tree search for joint surgical gesture segmentation and classification. An agent is trained to segment and classify the surgical video in a human-like manner whose direct decisions are re-considered by tree search appropriately. Our proposed tree search algorithm unites the outputs from two designed neural networks, i.e., policy and value network. With the integration of complementary information from distinct models, our framework is able to achieve the better performance than baseline methods using either of the neural networks. For an overall evaluation, our developed approach consistently outperforms the existing methods on the suturing task of JIGSAWS dataset in terms of accuracy, edit score and F1 score. Our study highlights the utilization of tree search to refine actions in reinforcement learning framework for surgical robotic applications. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08718">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 84	An empirical study of Conv-TasNet</h3><h4>Berkan Kadioglu, Michael Horgan, Xiaoyu Liu, Jordi Pons, Dan Darcy, Vivek Kumar</h4> Abstract: Conv-TasNet is a recently proposed waveform-based deep neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech source separation. Its architecture consists of a learnable encoder/decoder and a separator that operates on top of this learned space. Various improvements have been proposed to Conv-TasNet. However, they mostly focus on the separator, leaving its encoder/decoder as a (shallow) linear operator. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of Conv-TasNet and propose an enhancement to the encoder/decoder that is based on a (deep) non-linear variant of it. In addition, we experiment with the larger and more diverse LibriTTS dataset and investigate the generalization capabilities of the studied models when trained on a much larger dataset. We propose cross-dataset evaluation that includes assessing separations from the WSJ0-2mix, LibriTTS and VCTK databases. Our results show that enhancements to the encoder/decoder can improve average SI-SNR performance by more than 1 dB. Furthermore, we offer insights into the generalization capabilities of Conv-TasNet and the potential value of improvements to the encoder/decoder. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08688">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 85	Learning Gaussian Graphical Models via Multiplicative Weights</h3><h4>Anamay Chaturvedi, Jonathan Scarlett</h4> Abstract: Graphical model selection in Markov random fields is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. Two particularly prominent models, the Ising model and Gaussian model, have largely developed in parallel using different (though often related) techniques, and several practical algorithms with rigorous sample complexity bounds have been established for each. In this paper, we adapt a recently proposed algorithm of Klivans and Meka (FOCS, 2017), based on the method of multiplicative weight updates, from the Ising model to the Gaussian model, via non-trivial modifications to both the algorithm and its analysis. The algorithm enjoys a sample complexity bound that is qualitatively similar to others in the literature, has a low runtime $O(mp^2)$ in the case of $m$ samples and $p$ nodes, and can trivially be implemented in an online manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08663">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 86	Computational Design with Crowds</h3><h4>Yuki Koyama, Takeo Igarashi</h4> Abstract: Computational design is aimed at supporting or automating design processes using computational techniques. However, some classes of design tasks involve criteria that are difficult to handle only with computers. For example, visual design tasks seeking to fulfill aesthetic goals are difficult to handle purely with computers. One promising approach is to leverage human computation; that is, to incorporate human input into the computation process. Crowdsourcing platforms provide a convenient way to integrate such human computation into a working system. In this chapter, we discuss such computational design with crowds in the domain of parameter tweaking tasks in visual design. Parameter tweaking is often performed to maximize the aesthetic quality of designed objects. Computational design powered by crowds can solve this maximization problem by leveraging human computation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of computational design with crowds with two illustrative examples: (1) estimating the objective function (specifically, preference learning from crowds' pairwise comparisons) to facilitate interactive design exploration by a designer and (2) directly searching for the optimal parameter setting that maximizes the objective function (specifically, crowds-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08657">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 87	Balancing Cost and Benefit with Tied-Multi Transformers</h3><h4>Raj Dabre, Raphael Rubino, Atsushi Fujita</h4> Abstract: We propose and evaluate a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers with tied parameters which compresses multiple models into one enabling the dynamic choice of the number of encoder and decoder layers during decoding. In sequence-to-sequence modeling, typically, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of NxM losses, where each loss is computed from the output of one of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a model subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers, and can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and decoder layers. We then propose a mechanism to choose a priori the number of encoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and also explore recurrent stacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present a cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine translation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving translation quality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08614">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 88	KaoKore: A Pre-modern Japanese Art Facial Expression Dataset</h3><h4>Yingtao Tian, Chikahiko Suzuki, Tarin Clanuwat, Mikel Bober-Irizar, Alex Lamb, Asanobu Kitamoto</h4> Abstract: From classifying handwritten digits to generating strings of text, the datasets which have received long-time focus from the machine learning community vary greatly in their subject matter. This has motivated a renewed interest in building datasets which are socially and culturally relevant, so that algorithmic research may have a more direct and immediate impact on society. One such area is in history and the humanities, where better and relevant machine learning models can accelerate research across various fields. To this end, newly released benchmarks and models have been proposed for transcribing historical Japanese cursive writing, yet for the field as a whole using machine learning for historical Japanese artworks still remains largely uncharted. To bridge this gap, in this work we propose a new dataset KaoKore which consists of faces extracted from pre-modern Japanese artwork. We demonstrate its value as both a dataset for image classification as well as a creative and artistic dataset, which we explore using generative models.

<h3>No. 89	Syndrome-aware Herb Recommendation with Multi-Graph Convolution Network</h3><h4>Yuanyuan Jin, Wei Zhang, Xiangnan He, Xinyu Wang, Xiaoling Wang</h4> Abstract: Herb recommendation plays a crucial role in the therapeutic process of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), which aims to recommend a set of herbs to treat the symptoms of a patient. While several machine learning methods have been developed for herb recommendation, they are limited in modeling only the interactions between herbs and symptoms, and ignoring the intermediate process of syndrome induction. When performing TCM diagnostics, an experienced doctor typically induces syndromes from the patient's symptoms and then suggests herbs based on the induced syndromes. As such, we believe the induction of syndromes, an overall description of the symptoms, is important for herb recommendation and should be properly handled. However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of syndrome induction, most prescriptions lack the explicit ground truth of syndromes. In this paper, we propose a new method that takes the implicit syndrome induction process into account for herb recommendation. Given a set of symptoms to treat, we aim to generate an overall syndrome representation by effectively fusing the embeddings of all the symptoms in the set, to mimic how a doctor induces the syndromes. Towards symptom embedding learning, we additionally construct a symptom-symptom graph from the input prescriptions for capturing the relations between symptoms; we then build graph convolution networks(GCNs) on both symptom-symptom and symptom-herb graphs to learn symptom embedding. Similarly, we construct a herb-herb graph and build GCNs on both herb-herb and symptom-herb graphs to learn herb embedding, which is finally interacted with the syndrome representation to predict the scores of herbs. In this way, more comprehensive representations can be obtained. We conduct extensive experiments on a public TCM dataset, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art herb recommendation methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08575">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 90	The continuous categorical: a novel simplex-valued exponential family</h3><h4>Elliott Gordon-Rodriguez, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem, John P. Cunningham</h4> Abstract: Simplex-valued data appear throughout statistics and machine learning, for example in the context of transfer learning and compression of deep networks. Existing models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data - the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08563">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 91	Federated pretraining and fine tuning of BERT using clinical notes from  multiple silos</h3><h4>Dianbo Liu, Tim Miller</h4> Abstract: Large scale contextual representation models, such as BERT, have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) in recently years. However, in certain area like healthcare, accessing diverse large scale text data from multiple institutions is extremely challenging due to privacy and regulatory reasons. In this article, we show that it is possible to both pretrain and fine tune BERT models in a federated manner using clinical texts from different silos without moving the data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08562">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 92	Learning to Walk in the Real World with Minimal Human Effort</h3><h4>Sehoon Ha, Peng Xu, Zhenyu Tan, Sergey Levine, Jie Tan</h4> Abstract: Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental challenges for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged as a promising method for developing such control policies autonomously. In this paper, we develop a system for learning legged locomotion policies with deep RL in the real world with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for on-robot learning systems are automatic data collection and safety. We overcome these two challenges by developing a multi-task learning procedure, an automatic reset controller, and a safety-constrained RL framework. We tested our system on the task of learning to walk on three different terrains: flat ground, a soft mattress, and a doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently learn locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08550">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 93	Do We Really Need to Access the Source Data? Source Hypothesis Transfer  for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Jian Liang, Dapeng Hu, Jiashi Feng</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to leverage the knowledge learned from a labeled source dataset to solve similar tasks in a new unlabeled domain. Prior UDA methods typically require to access the source data when learning to adapt the model, making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. In this work we tackle a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and investigate how we can effectively utilize such a model without source data to solve UDA problems. To this end, we propose a simple yet generic representation learning framework, named \emph{Source HypOthesis Transfer} (SHOT). Specifically, SHOT freezes the classifier module (hypothesis) of the source model and learns the target-specific feature extraction module by exploiting both information maximization and self-supervised pseudo-labeling to implicitly align representations from the target domains to the source hypothesis. In this way, the learned target model can directly predict the labels of target data. We further investigate several techniques to refine the network architecture to parameterize the source model for better transfer performance. To verify its versatility, we evaluate SHOT in a variety of adaptation cases including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set domain adaptation. Experiments indicate that SHOT yields state-of-the-art results among multiple domain adaptation benchmarks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08546">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 94	A Scalable Framework for Sparse Clustering Without Shrinkage</h3><h4>Zhiyue Zhang, Kenneth Lange, Jason Xu</h4> Abstract: Clustering, a fundamental activity in unsupervised learning, is notoriously difficult when the feature space is high-dimensional. Fortunately, in many realistic scenarios, only a handful of features are relevant in distinguishing clusters. This has motivated the development of sparse clustering techniques that typically rely on k-means within outer algorithms of high computational complexity. Current techniques also require careful tuning of shrinkage parameters, further limiting their scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for sparse k-means clustering that is intuitive, simple to implement, and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. We show that our algorithm enjoys consistency and convergence guarantees. Our core method readily generalizes to several task-specific algorithms such as clustering on subsets of attributes and in partially observed data settings. We showcase these contributions via simulated experiments and benchmark datasets, as well as a case study on mouse protein expression. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08541">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 95	Adaptive Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation</h3><h4>Tao Sun, Han Shen, Tianyi Chen, Dongsheng Li</h4> Abstract: This paper revisits the celebrated temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm for the policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Typically, the performance of the plain-vanilla TD algorithm is sensitive to the choice of stepsizes. Oftentimes, TD suffers from slow convergence. Motivated by the tight connection between the TD learning algorithm and the stochastic gradient methods, we develop the first adaptive variant of the TD learning algorithm with linear function approximation that we term AdaTD. In contrast to the original TD, AdaTD is robust or less sensitive to the choice of stepsizes. Analytically, we establish that to reach an $\epsilon$ accuracy, the number of iterations needed is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^2\ln^4\frac{1}{\epsilon}/\ln^4\frac{1}{\rho})$, where $\rho$ represents the speed of the underlying Markov chain converges to the stationary distribution. This implies that the iteration complexity of AdaTD is no worse than that of TD in the worst case. Going beyond TD, we further develop an adaptive variant of TD($\lambda$), which is referred to as AdaTD($\lambda$). We evaluate the empirical performance of AdaTD and AdaTD($\lambda$) on several standard reinforcement learning tasks in OpenAI Gym on both linear and nonlinear function approximation, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approaches over existing ones. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08537">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 96	Towards Physically-consistent, Data-driven Models of Convection</h3><h4>Tom Beucler, Michael Pritchard, Pierre Gentine, Stephan Rasp</h4> Abstract: Data-driven algorithms, in particular neural networks, can emulate the effect of sub-grid scale processes in coarse-resolution climate models if trained on high-resolution climate simulations. However, they may violate key physical constraints and lack the ability to generalize outside of their training set. Here, we show that physical constraints can be enforced in neural networks, either approximately by adapting the loss function or to machine precision by adapting the architecture. As these physical constraints are insufficient to guarantee generalizability, we additionally propose a framework to find physical normalizations that can be applied to the training and validation data to improve the ability of neural networks to generalize to unseen climates. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 97	Pulsars Detection by Machine Learning with Very Few Features</h3><h4>Haitao Lin, Xiangru Li, Ziying Luo</h4> Abstract: It is an active topic to investigate the schemes based on machine learning (ML) methods for detecting pulsars as the data volume growing exponentially in modern surveys. To improve the detection performance, input features into an ML model should be investigated specifically. In the existing pulsar detection researches based on ML methods, there are mainly two kinds of feature designs: the empirical features and statistical features. Due to the combinational effects from multiple features, however, there exist some redundancies and even irrelevant components in the available features, which can reduce the accuracy of a pulsar detection model. Therefore, it is essential to select a subset of relevant features from a set of available candidate features and known as {\itshape feature selection.} In this work, two feature selection algorithms ----\textit{Grid Search} (GS) and \textit{Recursive Feature Elimination} (RFE)---- are proposed to improve the detection performance by removing the redundant and irrelevant features. The algorithms were evaluated on the Southern High Time Resolution University survey (HTRU-S) with five pulsar detection models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed feature selection algorithms. By the GS, a model with only two features reach a recall rate as high as 99\% and a false positive rate (FPR) as low as 0.65\%; By the RFE, another model with only three features achieves a recall rate 99\% and an FPR of 0.16\% in pulsar candidates classification. Furthermore, this work investigated the number of features required as well as the misclassified pulsars by our models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08519">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 98	Causal Inference under Networked Interference</h3><h4>Yunpu Ma, Yuyi Wang, Volker Tresp</h4> Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments or observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment responses under interference. Hence, how to estimate the superimposed causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference becomes a challenging task in causal inference. In this work, we study causal effect estimation under general network interference using GNNs, which are powerful tools for capturing the dependency in the graph. After deriving causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference and treatment capacity constraint. Furthermore, a heuristic graph structure-dependent error bound for GNN-based causal estimators is provided. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08506">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 99	Stochastic Regret Minimization in Extensive-Form Games</h3><h4>Gabriele Farina, Christian Kroer, Tuomas Sandholm</h4> Abstract: Monte-Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving sequential games that are too large for full tree traversals. It works by using gradient estimates that can be computed via sampling. However, stochastic methods for sequential games have not been investigated extensively beyond MCCFR. In this paper we develop a new framework for developing stochastic regret minimization methods. This framework allows us to use any regret-minimization algorithm, coupled with any gradient estimator. The MCCFR algorithm can be analyzed as a special case of our framework, and this analysis leads to significantly-stronger theoretical on convergence, while simultaneously yielding a simplified proof. Our framework allows us to instantiate several new stochastic methods for solving sequential games. We show extensive experiments on three games, where some variants of our methods outperform MCCFR. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08493">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 100	Entrywise convergence of iterative methods for eigenproblems</h3><h4>Vasileios Charisopoulos, Austin R. Benson, Anil Damle</h4> Abstract: Several problems in machine learning, statistics, and other fields rely on computing eigenvectors. For large scale problems, the computation of these eigenvectors is typically performed via iterative schemes such as subspace iteration or Krylov methods. While there is classical and comprehensive analysis for subspace convergence guarantees with respect to the spectral norm, in many modern applications other notions of subspace distance are more appropriate. Recent theoretical work has focused on perturbations of subspaces measured in the $\ell_{2 \to \infty}$ norm, but does not consider the actual computation of eigenvectors. Here we address the convergence of subspace iteration when distances are measured in the $\ell_{2 \to \infty}$ norm and provide deterministic bounds. We complement our analysis with a practical stopping criterion and demonstrate its applicability via numerical experiments. Our results show that one can get comparable performance on downstream tasks while requiring fewer iterations, thereby saving substantial computational time. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08491">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 101	The Information in Emotion Communication</h3><h4>Alison Duncan Kerr, Kevin Scharp</h4> Abstract: How much information is transmitted when animals use emotions to communicate? It is clear that emotions are used as communication systems in humans and other species. The quantitative theory of emotion information presented here is based on Shannon's mathematical theory of information in communication systems. The theory explains myriad aspects of emotion communication and offers dozens of new directions for research. It is superior to the "contagion" theory of emotion spreading, which is currently dominant. One important application of the information theory of emotion communication is that it permits the development of emotion security systems for social networks to guard against the widespread emotion manipulation we see online today. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08470">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 102	Descriptive and Predictive Analysis of Euroleague Basketball Games and  the Wisdom of Basketball Crowds</h3><h4>Georgios Giasemidis</h4> Abstract: In this study we focus on the prediction of basketball games in the Euroleague competition using machine learning modelling. The prediction is a binary classification problem, predicting whether a match finishes 1 (home win) or 2 (away win). Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the "wisdom of the basketball crowd" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study. We argue why the accuracy level of this group of "experts" should be set as the benchmark for future studies in the prediction of (European) basketball games using machine learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08465">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 103	From Poincar√© Recurrence to Convergence in Imperfect Information  Games: Finding Equilibrium via Regularization</h3><h4>Julien Perolat, Remi Munos, Jean-Baptiste Lespiau, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Mark Rowland, Pedro Ortega, Neil Burch, Thomas Anthony, David Balduzzi, Bart De Vylder, Georgios Piliouras, Marc Lanctot, Karl Tuyls</h4> Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Follow the Regularized Leader dynamics in sequential imperfect information games (IIG). We generalize existing results of Poincar\'e recurrence from normal-form games to zero-sum two-player imperfect information games and other sequential game settings. We then investigate how adapting the reward (by adding a regularization term) of the game can give strong convergence guarantees in monotone games. We continue by showing how this reward adaptation technique can be leveraged to build algorithms that converge exactly to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we show how these insights can be directly used to build state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for zero-sum two-player Imperfect Information Games (IIG). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08456">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 104	SD-GAN: Structural and Denoising GAN reveals facial parts under  occlusion</h3><h4>Samik Banerjee, Sukhendu Das</h4> Abstract: Certain facial parts are salient (unique) in appearance, which substantially contribute to the holistic recognition of a subject. Occlusion of these salient parts deteriorates the performance of face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generative model to reconstruct the missing parts of the face which are under occlusion. The proposed generative model (SD-GAN) reconstructs a face preserving the illumination variation and identity of the face. A novel adversarial training algorithm has been designed for a bimodal mutually exclusive Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, for faster convergence. A novel adversarial "structural" loss function is also proposed, comprising of two components: a holistic and a local loss, characterized by SSIM and patch-wise MSE. Ablation studies on real and synthetically occluded face datasets reveal that our proposed technique outperforms the competing methods by a considerable margin, even for boosting the performance of Face Recognition. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08448">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 105	Simultaneous Inference for Massive Data: Distributed Bootstrap</h3><h4>Yang Yu, Shih-Kang Chao, Guang Cheng</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bootstrap method applied to massive data processed distributedly in a large number of machines. This new method is computationally efficient in that we bootstrap on the master machine without over-resampling, typically required by existing methods \cite{kleiner2014scalable,sengupta2016subsampled}, while provably achieving optimal statistical efficiency with minimal communication. Our method does not require repeatedly re-fitting the model but only applies multiplier bootstrap in the master machine on the gradients received from the worker machines. Simulations validate our theory. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08443">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 106	Fine tuning U-Net for ultrasound image segmentation: which layers?</h3><h4>Mina Amiri, Rupert Brooks, Hassan Rivaz</h4> Abstract: Fine-tuning a network which has been trained on a large dataset is an alternative to full training in order to overcome the problem of scarce and expensive data in medical applications. While the shallow layers of the network are usually kept unchanged, deeper layers are modified according to the new dataset. This approach may not work for ultrasound images due to their drastically different appearance. In this study, we investigated the effect of fine-tuning different layers of a U-Net which was trained on segmentation of natural images in breast ultrasound image segmentation. Tuning the contracting part and fixing the expanding part resulted in substantially better results compared to fixing the contracting part and tuning the expanding part. Furthermore, we showed that starting to fine-tune the U-Net from the shallow layers and gradually including more layers will lead to a better performance compared to fine-tuning the network from the deep layers moving back to shallow layers. We did not observe the same results on segmentation of X-ray images, which have different salient features compared to ultrasound, it may therefore be more appropriate to fine-tune the shallow layers rather than deep layers. Shallow layers learn lower level features (including speckle pattern, and probably the noise and artifact properties) which are critical in automatic segmentation in this modality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08438">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 107	Residual Bootstrap Exploration for Bandit Algorithms</h3><h4>Chi-Hua Wang, Yang Yu, Botao Hao, Guang Cheng</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel perturbation-based exploration method in bandit algorithms with bounded or unbounded rewards, called residual bootstrap exploration (\texttt{ReBoot}). The \texttt{ReBoot} enforces exploration by injecting data-driven randomness through a residual-based perturbation mechanism. This novel mechanism captures the underlying distributional properties of fitting errors, and more importantly boosts exploration to escape from suboptimal solutions (for small sample sizes) by inflating variance level in an \textit{unconventional} way. In theory, with appropriate variance inflation level, \texttt{ReBoot} provably secures instance-dependent logarithmic regret in Gaussian multi-armed bandits. We evaluate the \texttt{ReBoot} in different synthetic multi-armed bandits problems and observe that the \texttt{ReBoot} performs better for unbounded rewards and more robustly than \texttt{Giro} \cite{kveton2018garbage} and \texttt{PHE} \cite{kveton2019perturbed}, with comparable computational efficiency to the Thompson sampling method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08436">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 108	Weakly-supervised Multi-output Regression via Correlated Gaussian  Processes</h3><h4>Seokhyun Chung, Raed Al Kontar, Zhenke Wu</h4> Abstract: Multi-output regression seeks to infer multiple latent functions using data from multiple groups/sources while accounting for potential between-group similarities. In this paper, we consider multi-output regression under a weakly-supervised setting where a subset of data points from multiple groups are unlabeled. We use dependent Gaussian processes for multiple outputs constructed by convolutions with shared latent processes. We introduce hyperpriors for the multinomial probabilities of the unobserved labels and optimize the hyperparameters which we show improves estimation. We derive two variational bounds: (i) a modified variational bound for fast and stable convergence in model inference, (ii) a scalable variational bound that is amenable to stochastic optimization. We use experiments on synthetic and real-world data to show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with more accurate estimation of multiple latent functions and unobserved labels. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08412">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 109	A Unified Framework for Gaussian Mixture Reduction with Composite  Transportation Distance</h3><h4>Qiong Zhang, Jiahua Chen</h4> Abstract: Gaussian mixture reduction (GMR) is the problem of approximating a finite Gaussian mixture by one with fewer components. It is widely used in density estimation, nonparametric belief propagation, and Bayesian recursive filtering. Although optimization and clustering-based algorithms have been proposed for GMR, they are either computationally expensive or lacking in theoretical supports. In this work, we propose to perform GMR by minimizing the entropic regularized composite transportation distance between two mixtures. We show our approach provides a unified framework for GMR that is both interpretable and computationally efficient. Our work also bridges the gap between optimization and clustering-based approaches for GMR. A Majorization-Minimization algorithm is developed for our optimization problem and its theoretical convergence is also established in this paper. Empirical experiments are also conducted to show the effectiveness of GMR. The effect of the choice of transportation cost on the performance of GMR is also investigated. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08410">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 110	Implicit Regularization of Random Feature Models</h3><h4>Arthur Jacot, Berfin ≈ûim≈üek, Francesco Spadaro, Cl√©ment Hongler, Franck Gabriel</h4> Abstract: Random Feature (RF) models are used as efficient parametric approximations of kernel methods. We investigate, by means of random matrix theory, the connection between Gaussian RF models and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). For a Gaussian RF model with $P$ features, $N$ data points, and a ridge $\lambda$, we show that the average (i.e. expected) RF predictor is close to a KRR predictor with an effective ridge $\tilde{\lambda}$. We show that $\tilde{\lambda} > \lambda$ and $\tilde{\lambda} \searrow \lambda$ monotonically as $P$ grows, thus revealing the implicit regularization effect of finite RF sampling. We then compare the risk (i.e. test error) of the $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor with the average risk of the $\lambda$-RF predictor and obtain a precise and explicit bound on their difference. Finally, we empirically find an extremely good agreement between the test errors of the average $\lambda$-RF predictor and $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08404">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 111	MonoLayout: Amodal scene layout from a single image</h3><h4>Kaustubh Mani, Swapnil Daga, Shubhika Garg, N. Sai Shankar, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, K. Madhava Krishna</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the novel, highly challenging problem of estimating the layout of a complex urban driving scenario. Given a single color image captured from a driving platform, we aim to predict the bird's-eye view layout of the road and other traffic participants. The estimated layout should reason beyond what is visible in the image, and compensate for the loss of 3D information due to projection. We dub this problem amodal scene layout estimation, which involves "hallucinating" scene layout for even parts of the world that are occluded in the image. To this end, we present MonoLayout, a deep neural network for real-time amodal scene layout estimation from a single image. We represent scene layout as a multi-channel semantic occupancy grid, and leverage adversarial feature learning to hallucinate plausible completions for occluded image parts. Due to the lack of fair baseline methods, we extend several state-of-the-art approaches for road-layout estimation and vehicle occupancy estimation in bird's-eye view to the amodal setup for rigorous evaluation. By leveraging temporal sensor fusion to generate training labels, we significantly outperform current art over a number of datasets. On the KITTI and Argoverse datasets, we outperform all baselines by a significant margin. We also make all our annotations, and code publicly available.

<h3>No. 112	Comparative Visual Analytics for Assessing Medical Records with Sequence  Embedding</h3><h4>Rongchen Guo, Takanori Fujiwara, Yiran Li, Kelly M. Lima, Soman Sen, Nam K. Tran, Kwan-Liu Ma</h4> Abstract: Machine learning for data-driven diagnosis has been actively studied in medicine to provide better healthcare. Supporting analysis of a patient cohort similar to a patient under treatment is a key task for clinicians to make decisions with high confidence. However, such analysis is not straightforward due to the characteristics of medical records: high dimensionality, irregularity in time, and sparsity. To address this challenge, we introduce a method for similarity calculation of medical records. Our method employs event and sequence embeddings. While we use an autoencoder for the event embedding, we apply its variant with the self-attention mechanism for the sequence embedding. Moreover, in order to better handle the irregularity of data, we enhance the self-attention mechanism with consideration of different time intervals. We have developed a visual analytics system to support comparative studies of patient records. To make a comparison of sequences with different lengths easier, our system incorporates a sequence alignment method. Through its interactive interface, the user can quickly identify patients of interest and conveniently review both the temporal and multivariate aspects of the patient records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and system with case studies using a real-world dataset from the neonatal intensive care unit of UC Davis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08356">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 113	Optimal Multiple Stopping Rule for Warm-Starting Sequential Selection</h3><h4>Mathilde Fekom, Nicolas Vayatis, Argyris Kalogeratos</h4> Abstract: In this paper we present the Warm-starting Dynamic Thresholding algorithm, developed using dynamic programming, for a variant of the standard online selection problem. The problem allows job positions to be either free or already occupied at the beginning of the process. Throughout the selection process, the decision maker interviews one after the other the new candidates and reveals a quality score for each of them. Based on that information, she can (re)assign each job at most once by taking immediate and irrevocable decisions. We relax the hard requirement of the class of dynamic programming algorithms to perfectly know the distribution from which the scores of candidates are drawn, by presenting extensions for the partial and no-information cases, in which the decision maker can learn the underlying score distribution sequentially while interviewing candidates. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.05160">PDF</a><h2>2020-02-22</h2>
<h3>No. 1	Improving Sampling Accuracy of Stochastic Gradient MCMC Methods via  Non-uniform Subsampling of Gradients</h3><h4>Ruilin Li, Xin Wang, Hongyuan Zha, Molei Tao</h4> Abstract: Common Stochastic Gradient MCMC methods approximate gradients by stochastic ones via uniformly subsampled data points. We propose that a non-uniform subsampling can reduce the variance introduced by the stochastic approximation, hence making the sampling of a target distribution more accurate. An exponentially weighted stochastic gradient approach (EWSG) is developed for this objective by matching the transition kernels of SG-MCMC methods respectively based on stochastic and batch gradients. A demonstration of EWSG combined with second-order Langevin equation for sampling purposes is provided. In our method, non-uniform subsampling is done efficiently via a Metropolis-Hasting chain on the data index, which is coupled to the sampling algorithm. The fact that our method has reduced local variance with high probability is theoretically analyzed. A non-asymptotic global error analysis is also presented. Numerical experiments based on both synthetic and real world data sets are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches. While statistical accuracy has improved, the speed of convergence was empirically observed to be at least comparable to the uniform version. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08949">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Nystr√∂m Subspace Learning for Large-scale SVMs</h3><h4>Weida Li, Mingxia Liu, Daoqiang Zhang</h4> Abstract: As an implementation of the Nystr\"{o}m method, Nystr\"{o}m computational regularization (NCR) imposed on kernel classification and kernel ridge regression has proven capable of achieving optimal bounds in the large-scale statistical learning setting, while enjoying much better time complexity. In this study, we propose a Nystr\"{o}m subspace learning (NSL) framework to reveal that all you need for employing the Nystr\"{o}m method, including NCR, upon any kernel SVM is to use the efficient off-the-shelf linear SVM solvers as a black box. Based on our analysis, the bounds developed for the Nystr\"{o}m method are linked to NSL, and the analytical difference between two distinct implementations of the Nystr\"{o}m method is clearly presented. Besides, NSL also leads to sharper theoretical results for the clustered Nystr\"{o}m method. Finally, both regression and classification tasks are performed to compare two implementations of the Nystr\"{o}m method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08937">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Meta-learning for mixed linear regression</h3><h4>Weihao Kong, Raghav Somani, Zhao Song, Sham Kakade, Sewoong Oh</h4> Abstract: In modern supervised learning, there are a large number of tasks, but many of them are associated with only a small amount of labeled data. These include data from medical image processing and robotic interaction. Even though each individual task cannot be meaningfully trained in isolation, one seeks to meta-learn across the tasks from past experiences by exploiting some similarities. We study a fundamental question of interest: When can abundant tasks with small data compensate for lack of tasks with big data? We focus on a canonical scenario where each task is drawn from a mixture of $k$ linear regressions, and identify sufficient conditions for such a graceful exchange to hold; The total number of examples necessary with only small data tasks scales similarly as when big data tasks are available. To this end, we introduce a novel spectral approach and show that we can efficiently utilize small data tasks with the help of $\tilde\Omega(k^{3/2})$ medium data tasks each with $\tilde\Omega(k^{1/2})$ examples. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08936">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Online high rank matrix completion</h3><h4>Jicong Fan, Madeleine Udell</h4> Abstract: Recent advances in matrix completion enable data imputation in full-rank matrices by exploiting low dimensional (nonlinear) latent structure. In this paper, we develop a new model for high rank matrix completion (HRMC), together with batch and online methods to fit the model and out-of-sample extension to complete new data. The method works by (implicitly) mapping the data into a high dimensional polynomial feature space using the kernel trick; importantly, the data occupies a low dimensional subspace in this feature space, even when the original data matrix is of full-rank. We introduce an explicit parametrization of this low dimensional subspace, and an online fitting procedure, to reduce computational complexity compared to the state of the art. The online method can also handle streaming or sequential data and adapt to non-stationary latent structure. We provide guidance on the sampling rate required these methods to succeed. Experimental results on synthetic data and motion capture data validate the performance of the proposed methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08934">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Multi-step Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>J. H. Moon, Debasmit Das, C. S. George Lee</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the Online Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (OUDA) problem, where the target data are unlabelled and arriving sequentially. The traditional methods on the OUDA problem mainly focus on transforming each arriving target data to the source domain, and they do not sufficiently consider the temporal coherency and accumulative statistics among the arriving target data. We propose a multi-step framework for the OUDA problem, which institutes a novel method to compute the mean-target subspace inspired by the geometrical interpretation on the Euclidean space. This mean-target subspace contains accumulative temporal information among the arrived target data. Moreover, the transformation matrix computed from the mean-target subspace is applied to the next target data as a preprocessing step, aligning the target data closer to the source domain. Experiments on four datasets demonstrated the contribution of each step in our proposed multi-step OUDA framework and its performance over previous approaches. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08930">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Regularized Autoencoders via Relaxed Injective Probability Flow</h3><h4>Abhishek Kumar, Ben Poole, Kevin Murphy</h4> Abstract: Invertible flow-based generative models are an effective method for learning to generate samples, while allowing for tractable likelihood computation and inference. However, the invertibility requirement restricts models to have the same latent dimensionality as the inputs. This imposes significant architectural, memory, and computational costs, making them more challenging to scale than other classes of generative models such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). We propose a generative model based on probability flows that does away with the bijectivity requirement on the model and only assumes injectivity. This also provides another perspective on regularized autoencoders (RAEs), with our final objectives resembling RAEs with specific regularizers that are derived by lower bounding the probability flow objective. We empirically demonstrate the promise of the proposed model, improving over VAEs and AEs in terms of sample quality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08927">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Dissipative SymODEN: Encoding Hamiltonian Dynamics with Dissipation and  Control into Deep Learning</h3><h4>Yaofeng Desmond Zhong, Biswadip Dey, Amit Chakraborty</h4> Abstract: In this work, we introduce Dissipative SymODEN, a deep learning architecture which can infer the dynamics of a physical system with dissipation from observed state trajectories. To improve prediction accuracy while reducing network size, Dissipative SymODEN encodes the port-Hamiltonian dynamics with energy dissipation and external input into the design of its computation graph and learns the dynamics in a structured way. The learned model, by revealing key aspects of the system, such as the inertia, dissipation, and potential energy, paves the way for energy-based controllers. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08860">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	A Bayes-Optimal View on Adversarial Examples</h3><h4>Eitan Richardson, Yair Weiss</h4> Abstract: The ability to fool modern CNN classifiers with tiny perturbations of the input has lead to the development of a large number of candidate defenses and often conflicting explanations. In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial examples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct realistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be efficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions so that the optimal classifier is either robust or vulnerable. By training different classifiers on these datasets (for which the "gold standard" optimal classifiers are known), we can disentangle the possible sources of vulnerability and avoid the accuracy-robustness tradeoff that may occur in commonly used datasets. Our results show that even when the optimal classifier is robust, standard CNN training consistently learns a vulnerable classifier. At the same time, for exactly the same training data, RBF SVMs consistently learn a robust classifier. The same trend is observed in experiments with real images. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08859">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	On the Decision Boundaries of Deep Neural Networks: A Tropical Geometry  Perspective</h3><h4>Motasem Alfarra, Adel Bibi, Hasan Hammoud, Mohamed Gaafar, Bernard Ghanem</h4> Abstract: This work tackles the problem of characterizing and understanding the decision boundaries of neural networks with piecewise linear non-linearity activations. We use tropical geometry, a new development in the area of algebraic geometry, to characterize the decision boundaries of a simple neural network of the form (Affine, ReLU, Affine). Our main finding is that the decision boundaries are a subset of a tropical hypersurface, which is intimately related to a polytope formed by the convex hull of two zonotopes. The generators of these zonotopes are functions of the neural network parameters. This geometric characterization provides new perspective to three tasks. Specifically, we propose a new tropical perspective to the lottery ticket hypothesis, where we see the effect of different initializations on the tropical geometric representation of a network's decision boundaries. Moreover, we use this characterization to propose a new set of tropical regularizers, which directly deal with the decision boundaries of a network. We investigate the use of these regularizers in neural network pruning (by removing network parameters that do not contribute to the tropical geometric representation of the decision boundaries) and in generating adversarial input attacks (by producing input perturbations that explicitly perturb the decision boundaries' geometry and ultimately change the network's prediction). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08838">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	No-Regret and Incentive-Compatible Online Learning</h3><h4>Rupert Freeman, David M. Pennock, Chara Podimata, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan</h4> Abstract: We study online learning settings in which experts act strategically to maximize their influence on the learning algorithm's predictions by potentially misreporting their beliefs about a sequence of binary events. Our goal is twofold. First, we want the learning algorithm to be no-regret with respect to the best fixed expert in hindsight. Second, we want incentive compatibility, a guarantee that each expert's best strategy is to report his true beliefs about the realization of each event. To achieve this goal, we build on the literature on wagering mechanisms, a type of multi-agent scoring rule. We provide algorithms that achieve no regret and incentive compatibility for myopic experts for both the full and partial information settings. In experiments on datasets from FiveThirtyEight, our algorithms have regret comparable to classic no-regret algorithms, which are not incentive-compatible. Finally, we identify an incentive-compatible algorithm for forward-looking strategic agents that exhibits diminishing regret in practice. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08837">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Differential Dynamic Programming Neural Optimizer</h3><h4>Guan-Horng Liu, Tianrong Chen, Evangelos A. Theodorou</h4> Abstract: Interpretation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) training as an optimal control problem with nonlinear dynamical systems has received considerable attention recently, yet the algorithmic development remains relatively limited. In this work, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training procedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most widely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order trajectory optimization algorithm rooted in the Approximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new variant of DDP that can accept batch optimization for training feedforward networks, while integrating naturally with the recent progress in curvature approximation. The resulting algorithm features layer-wise feedback policies which improve convergence rate and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing methods. We show that the algorithm is competitive against state-ofthe-art first and second order methods. Our work opens up new avenues for principled algorithmic design built upon the optimal control theory. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08809">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Support-weighted Adversarial Imitation Learning</h3><h4>Ruohan Wang, Carlo Ciliberto, Pierluigi Amadori, Yiannis Demiris</h4> Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a broad family of imitation learning methods designed to mimic expert behaviors from demonstrations. While AIL has shown state-of-the-art performance on imitation learning with only small number of demonstrations, it faces several practical challenges such as potential training instability and implicit reward bias. To address the challenges, we propose Support-weighted Adversarial Imitation Learning (SAIL), a general framework that extends a given AIL algorithm with information derived from support estimation of the expert policies. SAIL improves the quality of the reinforcement signals by weighing the adversarial reward with a confidence score from support estimation of the expert policy. We also show that SAIL is always at least as efficient as the underlying AIL algorithm that SAIL uses for learning the adversarial reward. Empirically, we show that the proposed method achieves better performance and training stability than baseline methods on a wide range of benchmark control tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08803">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	A Structured Prediction Approach for Conditional Meta-Learning</h3><h4>Ruohan Wang, Yiannis Demiris, Carlo Ciliberto</h4> Abstract: Optimization-based meta-learning algorithms are a powerful class of methods for learning-to-learn applications such as few-shot learning. They tackle the limited availability of training data by leveraging the experience gained from previously observed tasks. However, when the complexity of the tasks distribution cannot be captured by a single set of shared meta-parameters, existing methods may fail to fully adapt to a target task. We address this issue with a novel perspective on conditional meta-learning based on structured prediction. We propose task-adaptive structured meta-learning (TASML), a principled estimator that weighs meta-training data conditioned on the target task to design tailored meta-learning objectives. In addition, we introduce algorithmic improvements to tackle key computational limitations of existing methods. Experimentally, we show that TASML outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. An ablation study quantifies the individual contribution of model components and suggests useful practices for meta-learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08799">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	How To Avoid Being Eaten By a Grue: Exploration Strategies for  Text-Adventure Agents</h3><h4>Prithviraj Ammanabrolu, Ethan Tien, Zhaochen Luo, Mark O. Riedl</h4> Abstract: Text-based games -- in which an agent interacts with the world through textual natural language -- present us with the problem of combinatorially-sized action-spaces. Most current reinforcement learning algorithms are not capable of effectively handling such a large number of possible actions per turn. Poor sample efficiency, consequently, results in agents that are unable to pass bottleneck states, where they are unable to proceed because they do not see the right action sequence to pass the bottleneck enough times to be sufficiently reinforced. Building on prior work using knowledge graphs in reinforcement learning, we introduce two new game state exploration strategies. We compare our exploration strategies against strong baselines on the classic text-adventure game, Zork1, where prior agent have been unable to get past a bottleneck where the agent is eaten by a Grue. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08795">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Bayesian Deep Learning and a Probabilistic Perspective of Generalization</h3><h4>Andrew Gordon Wilson, Pavel Izmailov</h4> Abstract: The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization, rather than using a single setting of weights. Bayesian marginalization can particularly improve the accuracy and calibration of modern deep neural networks, which are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many compelling but different solutions. We show that deep ensembles provide an effective mechanism for approximate Bayesian marginalization, and propose a related approach that further improves the predictive distribution by marginalizing within basins of attraction, without significant overhead. We also investigate the prior over functions implied by a vague distribution over neural network weights, explaining the generalization properties of such models from a probabilistic perspective. From this perspective, we explain results that have been presented as mysterious and distinct to neural network generalization, such as the ability to fit images with random labels, and show that these results can be reproduced with Gaussian processes. Finally, we provide a Bayesian perspective on tempering for calibrating predictive distributions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08791">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Dynamic Federated Learning</h3><h4>Elsa Rizk, Stefan Vlaski, Ali H. Sayed</h4> Abstract: Federated learning has emerged as an umbrella term for centralized coordination strategies in multi-agent environments. While many federated learning architectures process data in an online manner, and are hence adaptive by nature, most performance analyses assume static optimization problems and offer no guarantees in the presence of drifts in the problem solution or data characteristics. We consider a federated learning model where at every iteration, a random subset of available agents perform local updates based on their data. Under a non-stationary random walk model on the true minimizer for the aggregate optimization problem, we establish that the performance of the architecture is determined by three factors, namely, the data variability at each agent, the model variability across all agents, and a tracking term that is inversely proportional to the learning rate of the algorithm. The results clarify the trade-off between convergence and tracking performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08782">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Set2Graph: Learning Graphs From Sets</h3><h4>Hadar Serviansky, Nimrod Segol, Jonathan Shlomi, Kyle Cranmer, Eilam Gross, Haggai Maron, Yaron Lipman</h4> Abstract: Many problems in machine learning (ML) can be cast as learning functions from sets to graphs, or more generally to hypergraphs; in short, Set2Graph functions. Examples include clustering, learning vertex and edge features on graphs, and learning triplet data in a collection. Current neural network models that approximate Set2Graph functions come from two main ML sub-fields: equivariant learning, and similarity learning. Equivariant models would be in general computationally challenging or even infeasible, while similarity learning models can be shown to have limited expressive power. In this paper we suggest a neural network model family for learning Set2Graph functions that is both practical and of maximal expressive power (universal), that is, can approximate arbitrary continuous Set2Graph functions over compact sets. Testing our models on different machine learning tasks, including an application to particle physics, we find them favorable to existing baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08772">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 19	Towards Certifiable Adversarial Sample Detection</h3><h4>Ilia Shumailov, Yiren Zhao, Robert Mullins, Ross Anderson</h4> Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are deployed in more and more classification systems, but adversarial samples can be maliciously crafted to trick them, and are becoming a real threat. There have been various proposals to improve CNNs' adversarial robustness but these all suffer performance penalties or other limitations. In this paper, we provide a new approach in the form of a certifiable adversarial detection scheme, the Certifiable Taboo Trap (CTT). The system can provide certifiable guarantees of detection of adversarial inputs for certain $l_{\infty}$ sizes on a reasonable assumption, namely that the training data have the same distribution as the test data. We develop and evaluate several versions of CTT with a range of defense capabilities, training overheads and certifiability on adversarial samples. Against adversaries with various $l_p$ norms, CTT outperforms existing defense methods that focus purely on improving network robustness. We show that CTT has small false positive rates on clean test data, minimal compute overheads when deployed, and can support complex security policies. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08740">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Bimodal Distribution Removal and Genetic Algorithm in Neural Network for  Breast Cancer Diagnosis</h3><h4>Ke Quan</h4> Abstract: Diagnosis of breast cancer has been well studied in the past. Multiple linear programming models have been devised to approximate the relationship between cell features and tumour malignancy. However, these models are less capable in handling non-linear correlations. Neural networks instead are powerful in processing complex non-linear correlations. It is thus certainly beneficial to approach this cancer diagnosis problem with a model based on neural network. Particularly, introducing bias to neural network training process is deemed as an important means to increase training efficiency. Out of a number of popular proposed methods for introducing artificial bias, Bimodal Distribution Removal (BDR) presents ideal efficiency improvement results and fair simplicity in implementation. However, this paper examines the effectiveness of BDR against the target cancer diagnosis classification problem and shows that BDR process in fact negatively impacts classification performance. In addition, this paper also explores genetic algorithm as an efficient tool for feature selection and produced significantly better results comparing to baseline model that without any feature selection in place <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08729">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Do We Need Zero Training Loss After Achieving Zero Training Error?</h3><h4>Takashi Ishida, Ikko Yamane, Tomoya Sakai, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama</h4> Abstract: Overparameterized deep networks have the capacity to memorize training data with zero training error. Even after memorization, the training loss continues to approach zero, making the model overconfident and the test performance degraded. Since existing regularizers do not directly aim to avoid zero training loss, they often fail to maintain a moderate level of training loss, ending up with a too small or too large loss. We propose a direct solution called flooding that intentionally prevents further reduction of the training loss when it reaches a reasonably small value, which we call the flooding level. Our approach makes the loss float around the flooding level by doing mini-batched gradient descent as usual but gradient ascent if the training loss is below the flooding level. This can be implemented with one line of code, and is compatible with any stochastic optimizer and other regularizers. With flooding, the model will continue to "random walk" with the same non-zero training loss, and we expect it to drift into an area with a flat loss landscape that leads to better generalization. We experimentally show that flooding improves performance and as a byproduct, induces a double descent curve of the test loss. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08709">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	Performance Aware Convolutional Neural Network Channel Pruning for  Embedded GPUs</h3><h4>Valentin Radu, Kuba Kaszyk, Yuan Wen, Jack Turner, Jose Cano, Elliot J. Crowley, Bjorn Franke, Amos Storkey, Michael O'Boyle</h4> Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are becoming a common presence in many applications and services, due to their superior recognition accuracy. They are increasingly being used on mobile devices, many times just by porting large models designed for server space, although several model compression techniques have been considered. One model compression technique intended to reduce computations is channel pruning. Mobile and embedded systems now have GPUs which are ideal for the parallel computations of neural networks and for their lower energy cost per operation. Specialized libraries perform these neural network computations through highly optimized routines. As we find in our experiments, these libraries are optimized for the most common network shapes, making uninstructed channel pruning inefficient. We evaluate higher level libraries, which analyze the input characteristics of a convolutional layer, based on which they produce optimized OpenCL (Arm Compute Library and TVM) and CUDA (cuDNN) code. However, in reality, these characteristics and subsequent choices intended for optimization can have the opposite effect. We show that a reduction in the number of convolutional channels, pruning 12% of the initial size, is in some cases detrimental to performance, leading to 2x slowdown. On the other hand, we also find examples where performance-aware pruning achieves the intended results, with performance speedups of 3x with cuDNN and above 10x with Arm Compute Library and TVM. Our findings expose the need for hardware-instructed neural network pruning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08697">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Stochastic Optimization for Regularized Wasserstein Estimators</h3><h4>Marin Ballu, Quentin Berthet, Francis Bach</h4> Abstract: Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects. Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down first-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08695">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Unsupervised Multi-Class Domain Adaptation: Theory, Algorithms, and  Practice</h3><h4>Yabin Zhang, Bin Deng, Hui Tang, Lei Zhang, Kui Jia</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we study the formalism of unsupervised multi-class domain adaptation (multi-class UDA), which underlies some recent algorithms whose learning objectives are only motivated empirically. A Multi-Class Scoring Disagreement (MCSD) divergence is presented by aggregating the absolute margin violations in multi-class classification; the proposed MCSD is able to fully characterize the relations between any pair of multi-class scoring hypotheses. By using MCSD as a measure of domain distance, we develop a new domain adaptation bound for multi-class UDA as well as its data-dependent, probably approximately correct bound, which naturally suggest adversarial learning objectives to align conditional feature distributions across the source and target domains. Consequently, an algorithmic framework of Multi-class Domain-adversarial learning Networks (McDalNets) is developed, whose different instantiations via surrogate learning objectives either coincide with or resemble a few of recently popular methods, thus (partially) underscoring their practical effectiveness. Based on our same theory of multi-class UDA, we also introduce a new algorithm of Domain-Symmetric Networks (SymmNets), which is featured by a novel adversarial strategy of domain confusion and discrimination. SymmNets afford simple extensions that work equally well under the problem settings of either closed set, partial, or open set UDA. We conduct careful empirical studies to compare different algorithms of McDalNets and our newly introduced SymmNets. Experiments verify our theoretical analysis and show the efficacy of our proposed SymmNets. We make our implementation codes publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08681">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Learning with Differentiable Perturbed Optimizers</h3><h4>Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel, Olivier Teboul, Marco Cuturi, Jean-Philippe Vert, Francis Bach</h4> Abstract: Machine learning pipelines often rely on optimization procedures to make discrete decisions (e.g. sorting, picking closest neighbors, finding shortest paths or optimal matchings). Although these discrete decisions are easily computed in a forward manner, they cannot be used to modify model parameters using first-order optimization techniques because they break the back-propagation of computational graphs. In order to expand the scope of learning problems that can be solved in an end-to-end fashion, we propose a systematic method to transform a block that outputs an optimal discrete decision into a differentiable operation. Our approach relies on stochastic perturbations of these parameters, and can be used readily within existing solvers without the need for ad hoc regularization or smoothing. These perturbed optimizers yield solutions that are differentiable and never locally constant. The amount of smoothness can be tuned via the chosen noise amplitude, whose impact we analyze. The derivatives of these perturbed solvers can be evaluated efficiently. We also show how this framework can be connected to a family of losses developed in structured prediction, and describe how these can be used in unsupervised and supervised learning, with theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on several machine learning tasks in experiments on synthetic and real data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08676">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Discriminative Manifold Embedding and  Alignment</h3><h4>You-Wei Luo, Chuan-Xian Ren, Pengfei Ge, Ke-Kun Huang, Yu-Feng Yu</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation is effective in leveraging the rich information from the source domain to the unsupervised target domain. Though deep learning and adversarial strategy make an important breakthrough in the adaptability of features, there are two issues to be further explored. First, the hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are risky to the intrinsic data structure. Second, the batch-wise training manner in deep learning limits the description of the global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold learning framework is proposed to achieve transferability and discriminability consistently. As to the first problem, this method establishes a probabilistic discriminant criterion on the target domain via soft labels. Further, this criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second issue; such approximation is also memory-saving. The manifold metric alignment is exploited to be compatible with the embedding space. A theoretical error bound is derived to facilitate the alignment. Extensive experiments have been conducted to investigate the proposal and results of the comparison study manifest the superiority of consistent manifold learning framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08675">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Computationally Tractable Riemannian Manifolds for Graph Embeddings</h3><h4>Calin Cruceru, Gary B√©cigneul, Octavian-Eugen Ganea</h4> Abstract: Representing graphs as sets of node embeddings in certain curved Riemannian manifolds has recently gained momentum in machine learning due to their desirable geometric inductive biases, e.g., hierarchical structures benefit from hyperbolic geometry. However, going beyond embedding spaces of constant sectional curvature, while potentially more representationally powerful, proves to be challenging as one can easily lose the appeal of computationally tractable tools such as geodesic distances or Riemannian gradients. Here, we explore computationally efficient matrix manifolds, showcasing how to learn and optimize graph embeddings in these Riemannian spaces. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent improvements over Euclidean geometry while often outperforming hyperbolic and elliptical embeddings based on various metrics that capture different graph properties. Our results serve as new evidence for the benefits of non-Euclidean embeddings in machine learning pipelines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08665">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Adaptive Graph Auto-Encoder for General Data Clustering</h3><h4>Xuelong Li, Hongyuan Zhang, Rui Zhang</h4> Abstract: Graph based clustering plays an important role in clustering area. Recent studies about graph convolution neural networks have achieved impressive success on graph type data. However, in traditional clustering tasks, the graph structure of data does not exist such that the strategy to construct graph is crucial for performance. In addition, the existing graph auto-encoder based approaches perform poorly on weighted graph, which is widely used in graph based clustering. In this paper, we propose a graph auto-encoder with local structure preserving for general data clustering, which can update the constructed graph adaptively. The adaptive process is designed to utilize the non-Euclidean structure sufficiently. By combining generative model for graph embedding and graph based clustering, a graph auto-encoder with a novel decoder is developed and it performs well in weighted graph used scenarios. Extensive experiments prove the superiority of our model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08648">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Uncovering Coresets for Classification With Multi-Objective Evolutionary  Algorithms</h3><h4>Pietro Barbiero, Giovanni Squillero, Alberto Tonda</h4> Abstract: A coreset is a subset of the training set, using which a machine learning algorithm obtains performances similar to what it would deliver if trained over the whole original data. Coreset discovery is an active and open line of research as it allows improving training speed for the algorithms and may help human understanding the results. Building on previous works, a novel approach is presented: candidate corsets are iteratively optimized, adding and removing samples. As there is an obvious trade-off between limiting training size and quality of the results, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to minimize simultaneously the number of points in the set and the classification error. Experimental results on non-trivial benchmarks show that the proposed approach is able to deliver results that allow a classifier to obtain lower error and better ability of generalizing on unseen data than state-of-the-art coreset discovery techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08645">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder with Joint Clustering via Adjacency Sharing</h3><h4>Xuelong Li, Hongyuan Zhang, Rui Zhang</h4> Abstract: Graph convolution networks have attracted many attentions and several graph auto-encoder based clustering models are developed for attributed graph clustering. However, most existing approaches separate clustering and optimization of graph auto-encoder into two individual steps. In this paper, we propose a graph convolution network based clustering model, namely, Embedding Graph Auto-Encoder with JOint Clustering via Adjacency Sharing (\textit{EGAE-JOCAS}). As for the embedded model, we develop a novel joint clustering method, which combines relaxed k-means and spectral clustering and is applicable for the learned embedding. The proposed joint clustering shares the same adjacency within graph convolution layers. Two parts are optimized simultaneously through performing SGD and taking close-form solutions alternatively to ensure a rapid convergence. Moreover, our model is free to incorporate any mechanisms (e.g., attention) into graph auto-encoder. Extensive experiments are conducted to prove the superiority of EGAE-JOCAS. Sufficient theoretical analyses are provided to support the results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08643">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	A Novel Framework for Selection of GANs for an Application</h3><h4>Tanya Motwani, Manojkumar Parmar</h4> Abstract: Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a current focal point of research. The body of knowledge is fragmented, leading to a trial-error method while selecting an appropriate GAN for a given scenario. We provide a comprehensive summary of the evolution of GANs starting from its inception addressing issues like mode collapse, vanishing gradient, unstable training and non-convergence. We also provide a comparison of various GANs from the application point of view, its behaviour and implementation details. We propose a novel framework to identify candidate GANs for a specific use case based on architecture, loss, regularization and divergence. We also discuss application of the framework using an example, and we demonstrate a significant reduction in search space. This efficient way to determine potential GANs lowers unit economics of AI development for organizations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08641">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	The Benefits of Pairwise Discriminators for Adversarial Training</h3><h4>Shangyuan Tong, Timur Garipov, Tommi Jaakkola</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training methods typically align distributions by solving two-player games. However, in most current formulations, even if the generator aligns perfectly with data, a sub-optimal discriminator can still drive the two apart. Absent additional regularization, the instability can manifest itself as a never-ending game. In this paper, we introduce a family of objectives by leveraging pairwise discriminators, and show that only the generator needs to converge. The alignment, if achieved, would be preserved with any discriminator. We provide sufficient conditions for local convergence; characterize the capacity balance that should guide the discriminator and generator choices; and construct examples of minimally sufficient discriminators. Empirically, we illustrate the theory and the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic examples. Moreover, we show that practical methods derived from our approach can better generate higher-resolution images. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08621">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Boosting Adversarial Training with Hypersphere Embedding</h3><h4>Tianyu Pang, Xiao Yang, Yinpeng Dong, Kun Xu, Hang Su, Jun Zhu</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training (AT) is one of the most effective defenses to improve the adversarial robustness of deep learning models. In order to promote the reliability of the adversarially trained models, we propose to boost AT via incorporating hypersphere embedding (HE), which can regularize the adversarial features onto compact hypersphere manifolds. We formally demonstrate that AT and HE are well coupled, which tunes up the learning dynamics of AT from several aspects. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness and universality of HE by embedding it into the popular AT frameworks including PGD-AT, ALP, and TRADES, as well as the FreeAT and FastAT strategies. In experiments, we evaluate our methods on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and verify that integrating HE can consistently enhance the performance of the models trained by each AT framework with little extra computation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08619">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Diversity sampling is an implicit regularization for kernel methods</h3><h4>Micha√´l Fanuel, Joachim Schreurs, Johan A.K. Suykens</h4> Abstract: Kernel methods have achieved very good performance on large scale regression and classification problems, by using the Nystr\"om method and preconditioning techniques. The Nystr\"om approximation -- based on a subset of landmarks -- gives a low rank approximation of the kernel matrix, and is known to provide a form of implicit regularization. We further elaborate on the impact of sampling diverse landmarks for constructing the Nystr\"om approximation in supervised as well as unsupervised kernel methods. By using Determinantal Point Processes for sampling, we obtain additional theoretical results concerning the interplay between diversity and regularization. Empirically, we demonstrate the advantages of training kernel methods based on subsets made of diverse points. In particular, if the dataset has a dense bulk and a sparser tail, we show that Nystr\"om kernel regression with diverse landmarks increases the accuracy of the regression in sparser regions of the dataset, with respect to a uniform landmark sampling. A greedy heuristic is also proposed to select diverse samples of significant size within large datasets when exact DPP sampling is not practically feasible. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08616">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Optimizing Black-box Metrics with Adaptive Surrogates</h3><h4>Qijia Jiang, Olaoluwa Adigun, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Mahdi Milani Fard, Maya Gupta</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of training models with black-box and hard-to-optimize metrics by expressing the metric as a monotonic function of a small number of easy-to-optimize surrogates. We pose the training problem as an optimization over a relaxed surrogate space, which we solve by estimating local gradients for the metric and performing inexact convex projections. We analyze gradient estimates based on finite differences and local linear interpolations, and show convergence of our approach under smoothness assumptions with respect to the surrogates. Experimental results on classification and ranking problems verify the proposal performs on par with methods that know the mathematical formulation, and adds notable value when the form of the metric is unknown. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08605">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	On Learning Sets of Symmetric Elements</h3><h4>Haggai Maron, Or Litany, Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya</h4> Abstract: Learning from unordered sets is a fundamental learning setup, which is attracting increasing attention. Research in this area has focused on the case where elements of the set are represented by feature vectors, and far less emphasis has been given to the common case where set elements themselves adhere to certain symmetries. That case is relevant to numerous applications, from deblurring image bursts to multi-view 3D shape recognition and reconstruction. In this paper, we present a principled approach to learning sets of general symmetric elements. We first characterize the space of linear layers that are equivariant both to element reordering and to the inherent symmetries of elements, like translation in the case of images. We further show that networks that are composed of these layers, called Deep Sets for Symmetric elements layers (DSS), are universal approximators of both invariant and equivariant functions. DSS layers are also straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that they improve over existing set-learning architectures in a series of experiments with images, graphs, and point-clouds. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08599">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	Interpretability of machine learning based prediction models in  healthcare</h3><h4>Gregor Stiglic, Primoz Kocbek, Nino Fijacko, Marinka Zitnik, Katrien Verbert, Leona Cilar</h4> Abstract: There is a need of ensuring machine learning models that are interpretable. Higher interpretability of the model means easier comprehension and explanation of future predictions for end-users. Further, interpretable machine learning models allow healthcare experts to make reasonable and data-driven decisions to provide personalized decisions that can ultimately lead to higher quality of service in healthcare. Generally, we can classify interpretability approaches in two groups where the first focuses on personalized interpretation (local interpretability) while the second summarizes prediction models on a population level (global interpretability). Alternatively, we can group interpretability methods into model-specific techniques, which are designed to interpret predictions generated by a specific model, such as a neural network, and model-agnostic approaches, which provide easy-to-understand explanations of predictions made by any machine learning model. Here, we give an overview of interpretability approaches and provide examples of practical interpretability of machine learning in different areas of healthcare, including prediction of health-related outcomes, optimizing treatments or improving the efficiency of screening for specific conditions. Further, we outline future directions for interpretable machine learning and highlight the importance of developing algorithmic solutions that can enable machine-learning driven decision making in high-stakes healthcare problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08596">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	Regret Minimization in Stochastic Contextual Dueling Bandits</h3><h4>Aadirupa Saha, Aditya Gopalan</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of stochastic $K$-armed dueling bandit in the contextual setting, where at each round the learner is presented with a context set of $K$ items, each represented by a $d$-dimensional feature vector, and the goal of the learner is to identify the best arm of each context sets. However, unlike the classical contextual bandit setup, our framework only allows the learner to receive item feedback in terms of their (noisy) pariwise preferences--famously studied as dueling bandits which is practical interests in various online decision making scenarios, e.g. recommender systems, information retrieval, tournament ranking, where it is easier to elicit the relative strength of the items instead of their absolute scores. However, to the best of our knowledge this work is the first to consider the problem of regret minimization of contextual dueling bandits for potentially infinite decision spaces and gives provably optimal algorithms along with a matching lower bound analysis. We present two algorithms for the setup with respective regret guarantees $\tilde O(d\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT \log K})$. Subsequently we also show that $\Omega(\sqrt {dT})$ is actually the fundamental performance limit for this problem, implying the optimality of our second algorithm. However the analysis of our first algorithm is comparatively simpler, and it is often shown to outperform the former empirically. Finally, we corroborate all the theoretical results with suitable experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08583">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Differentially Private ERM Based on Data Perturbation</h3><h4>Yilin Kang, Yong Liu, Lizhong Ding, Xinwang Liu, Xinyi Tong, Weiping Wang</h4> Abstract: In this paper, after observing that different training data instances affect the machine learning model to different extents, we attempt to improve the performance of differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM) from a new perspective. Specifically, we measure the contributions of various training data instances on the final machine learning model, and select some of them to add random noise. Considering that the key of our method is to measure each data instance separately, we propose a new `Data perturbation' based (DB) paradigm for DP-ERM: adding random noise to the original training data and achieving ($\epsilon,\delta$)-differential privacy on the final machine learning model, along with the preservation on the original data. By introducing the Influence Function (IF), we quantitatively measure the impact of the training data on the final model. Theoretical and experimental results show that our proposed DBDP-ERM paradigm enhances the model performance significantly. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08578">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Input Perturbation: A New Paradigm between Central and Local  Differential Privacy</h3><h4>Yilin Kang, Yong Liu, Ben Niu, Xinyi Tong, Likun Zhang, Weiping Wang</h4> Abstract: Traditionally, there are two models on differential privacy: the central model and the local model. The central model focuses on the machine learning model and the local model focuses on the training data. In this paper, we study the \textit{input perturbation} method in differentially private empirical risk minimization (DP-ERM), preserving privacy of the central model. By adding noise to the original training data and training with the `perturbed data', we achieve ($\epsilon$,$\delta$)-differential privacy on the final model, along with some kind of privacy on the original data. We observe that there is an interesting connection between the local model and the central model: the perturbation on the original data causes the perturbation on the gradient, and finally the model parameters. This observation means that our method builds a bridge between local and central model, protecting the data, the gradient and the model simultaneously, which is more superior than previous central methods. Detailed theoretical analysis and experiments show that our method achieves almost the same (or even better) performance as some of the best previous central methods with more protections on privacy, which is an attractive result. Moreover, we extend our method to a more general case: the loss function satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, which is more general than strong convexity, the constraint on the loss function in most previous work. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08570">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	Towards Byzantine-resilient Learning in Decentralized Systems</h3><h4>Shangwei Guo, Tianwei Zhang, Xiaofei Xie, Lei Ma, Tao Xiang, Yang Liu</h4> Abstract: With the proliferation of IoT and edge computing, decentralized learning is becoming more promising. When designing a distributed learning system, one major challenge to consider is Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). Past works have researched Byzantine-resilient solutions for centralized distributed learning. However, there are currently no satisfactory solutions with strong efficiency and security in decentralized systems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, Mozi, to achieve BFT in decentralized learning systems. Specifically, Mozi provides a uniform Byzantine-resilient aggregation rule for benign nodes to select the useful parameter updates and filter out the malicious ones in each training iteration. It guarantees that each benign node in a decentralized system can train a correct model under very strong Byzantine attacks with an arbitrary number of faulty nodes. We perform the theoretical analysis to prove the uniform convergence of our proposed algorithm. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the high security and efficiency of Mozi compared to all existing solutions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08569">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Multi-Agent Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Self-Powered and Sustainable  Edge Computing Systems</h3><h4>Md. Shirajum Munir, Nguyen H. Tran, Walid Saad, Choong Seon Hong</h4> Abstract: The stringent requirements of mobile edge computing (MEC) applications and functions fathom the high capacity and dense deployment of MEC hosts to the upcoming wireless networks. However, operating such high capacity MEC hosts can significantly increase energy consumption. Thus, a BS unit can act as a self-powered BS. In this paper, an effective energy dispatch mechanism for self-powered wireless networks with edge computing capabilities is studied. First, a two-stage linear stochastic programming problem is formulated with the goal of minimizing the total energy consumption cost of the system while fulfilling the energy demand. Second, a semi-distributed data-driven solution is proposed by developing a novel multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning (MAMRL) framework to solve the formulated problem. In particular, each BS plays the role of a local agent that explores a Markovian behavior for both energy consumption and generation while each BS transfers time-varying features to a meta-agent. Sequentially, the meta-agent optimizes (i.e., exploits) the energy dispatch decision by accepting only the observations from each local agent with its own state information. Meanwhile, each BS agent estimates its own energy dispatch policy by applying the learned parameters from meta-agent. Finally, the proposed MAMRL framework is benchmarked by analyzing deterministic, asymmetric, and stochastic environments in terms of non-renewable energy usages, energy cost, and accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed MAMRL model can reduce up to 11% non-renewable energy usage and by 22.4% the energy cost (with 95.8% prediction accuracy), compared to other baseline methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08567">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	Non-asymptotic and Accurate Learning of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</h3><h4>Yahya Sattar, Samet Oymak</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stabilizable systems governed by nonlinear state equation $h_{t+1}=\phi(h_t,u_t;\theta)+w_t$. Here $\theta$ is the unknown system dynamics, $h_t $ is the state, $u_t$ is the input and $w_t$ is the additive noise vector. We study gradient based algorithms to learn the system dynamics $\theta$ from samples obtained from a single finite trajectory. If the system is run by a stabilizing input policy, we show that temporally-dependent samples can be approximated by i.i.d. samples via a truncation argument by using mixing-time arguments. We then develop new guarantees for the uniform convergence of the gradients of empirical loss. Unlike existing work, our bounds are noise sensitive which allows for learning ground-truth dynamics with high accuracy and small sample complexity. Together, our results facilitate efficient learning of the general nonlinear system under stabilizing policy. We specialize our guarantees to entry-wise nonlinear activations and verify our theory in various numerical experiments <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Safe Counterfactual Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Yusuke Narita, Shota Yasui, Kohei Yata</h4> Abstract: We develop a method for predicting the performance of reinforcement learning and bandit algorithms, given historical data that may have been generated by a different algorithm. Our estimator has the property that its prediction converges in probability to the true performance of a counterfactual algorithm at the fast $\sqrt{N}$ rate, as the sample size $N$ increases. We also show a correct way to estimate the variance of our prediction, thus allowing the analyst to quantify the uncertainty in the prediction. These properties hold even when the analyst does not know which among a large number of potentially important state variables are really important. These theoretical guarantees make our estimator safe to use. We finally apply it to improve advertisement design by a major advertisement company. We find that our method produces smaller mean squared errors than state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08536">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Adaptive Sampling Distributed Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient for  Heterogeneous Distributed Datasets</h3><h4>Ilqar Ramazanli, Han Nguyen, Hai Pham, Sashank Reddi, Barnabas Poczos</h4> Abstract: We study distributed optimization algorithms for minimizing the average of \emph{heterogeneous} functions distributed across several machines with a focus on communication efficiency. In such settings, naively using the classical stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or its variants (e.g., SVRG) with a uniform sampling of machines typically yields poor performance. It often leads to the dependence of convergence rate on maximum Lipschitz constant of gradients across the devices. In this paper, we propose a novel \emph{adaptive} sampling of machines specially catered to these settings. Our method relies on an adaptive estimate of local Lipschitz constants base on the information of past gradients. We show that the new way improves the dependence of convergence rate from maximum Lipschitz constant to \emph{average} Lipschitz constant across machines, thereby, significantly accelerating the convergence. Our experiments demonstrate that our method indeed speeds up the convergence of the standard SVRG algorithm in heterogeneous environments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08528">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	NAttack! Adversarial Attacks to bypass a GAN based classifier trained to  detect Network intrusion</h3><h4>Aritran Piplai, Sai Sree Laya Chukkapalli, Anupam Joshi</h4> Abstract: With the recent developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning, anomalies in network traffic can be detected using machine learning approaches. Before the rise of machine learning, network anomalies which could imply an attack, were detected using well-crafted rules. An attacker who has knowledge in the field of cyber-defence could make educated guesses to sometimes accurately predict which particular features of network traffic data the cyber-defence mechanism is looking at. With this information, the attacker can circumvent a rule-based cyber-defense system. However, after the advancements of machine learning for network anomaly, it is not easy for a human to understand how to bypass a cyber-defence system. Recently, adversarial attacks have become increasingly common to defeat machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we show that even if we build a classifier and train it with adversarial examples for network data, we can use adversarial attacks and successfully break the system. We propose a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)based algorithm to generate data to train an efficient neural network based classifier, and we subsequently break the system using adversarial attacks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08527">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Scalable Constrained Bayesian Optimization</h3><h4>David Eriksson, Matthias Poloczek</h4> Abstract: The global optimization of a high-dimensional black-box function under black-box constraints is a pervasive task in machine learning, control, and engineering. These problems are difficult since the feasible set is typically non-convex and hard to find, in addition to the curses of dimensionality and the heterogeneity of the underlying functions. In particular, these characteristics dramatically impact the performance of Bayesian optimization methods, that otherwise have become the de-facto standard for sample-efficient optimization in unconstrained settings. Due to the lack of sample-efficient methods, practitioners usually fall back to evolutionary strategies or heuristics. We propose the scalable constrained Bayesian optimization (SCBO) algorithm that addresses the above challenges by data-independent transformations of the functions and follows the recent theme of local Bayesian optimization. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SCBO achieves excellent results and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08526">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	Avoiding Kernel Fixed Points: Computing with ELU and GELU Infinite  Networks</h3><h4>Russell Tsuchida, Tim Pearce, Christopher Van Der Heide, Fred Roosta, Marcus Gallagher</h4> Abstract: Analysing and computing with Gaussian processes arising from infinitely wide neural networks has recently seen a resurgence in popularity. Despite this, many explicit covariance functions of networks with activation functions used in modern networks remain unknown. Furthermore, while the kernels of deep networks can be computed iteratively, theoretical understanding of deep kernels is lacking, particularly with respect to fixed-point dynamics. Firstly, we derive the covariance functions of MLPs with exponential linear units and Gaussian error linear units and evaluate the performance of the limiting Gaussian processes on some benchmarks. Secondly, and more generally, we introduce a framework for analysing the fixed-point dynamics of iterated kernels corresponding to a broad range of activation functions. We find that unlike some previously studied neural network kernels, these new kernels exhibit non-trivial fixed-point dynamics which are mirrored in finite-width neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08517">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 49	Estimating Training Data Influence by Tracking Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Garima Pruthi, Frederick Liu, Mukund Sundararajan, Satyen Kale</h4> Abstract: We introduce a method called TrackIn that computes the influence of a training example on a prediction made by the model, by tracking how the loss on the test point changes during the training process whenever the training example of interest was utilized. We provide a scalable implementation of TrackIn via a combination of a few key ideas: (a) a first-order approximation to the exact computation, (b) using random projections to speed up the computation of the first-order approximation for large models, (c) using saved checkpoints of standard training procedures, and (d) cherry-picking layers of a deep neural network. An experimental evaluation shows that TrackIn is more effective in identifying mislabelled training examples than other related methods such as influence functions and representer points. We also discuss insights from applying the method on vision, regression and natural language tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08484">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 50	Strength from Weakness: Fast Learning Using Weak Supervision</h3><h4>Joshua Robinson, Stefanie Jegelka, Suvrit Sra</h4> Abstract: We study generalization properties of weakly supervised learning. That is, learning where only a few "strong" labels (the actual target of our prediction) are present but many more "weak" labels are available. In particular, we show that having access to weak labels can significantly accelerate the learning rate for the strong task to the fast rate of $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac1n)$, where $n$ denotes the number of strongly labeled data points. This acceleration can happen even if by itself the strongly labeled data admits only the slower $\mathcal{O}(\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ rate. The actual acceleration depends continuously on the number of weak labels available, and on the relation between the two tasks. Our theoretical results are reflected empirically across a range of tasks and illustrate how weak labels speed up learning on the strong task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08483">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 51	AdvMS: A Multi-source Multi-cost Defense Against Adversarial Attacks</h3><h4>Xiao Wang, Siyue Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xue Lin, Peter Chin</h4> Abstract: Designing effective defense against adversarial attacks is a crucial topic as deep neural networks have been proliferated rapidly in many security-critical domains such as malware detection and self-driving cars. Conventional defense methods, although shown to be promising, are largely limited by their single-source single-cost nature: The robustness promotion tends to plateau when the defenses are made increasingly stronger while the cost tends to amplify. In this paper, we study principles of designing multi-source and multi-cost schemes where defense performance is boosted from multiple defending components. Based on this motivation, we propose a multi-source and multi-cost defense scheme, Adversarially Trained Model Switching (AdvMS), that inherits advantages from two leading schemes: adversarial training and random model switching. We show that the multi-source nature of AdvMS mitigates the performance plateauing issue and the multi-cost nature enables improving robustness at a flexible and adjustable combination of costs over different factors which can better suit specific restrictions and needs in practice. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08439">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 52	PrivacyFL: A simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated  learning</h3><h4>Vaikkunth Mugunthan, Anton Peraire-Bueno, Lalana Kagal</h4> Abstract: Federated learning is a technique that enables distributed clients to collaboratively learn a shared machine learning model while keeping their training data localized. This reduces data privacy risks, however, privacy concerns still exist since it is possible to leak information about the training dataset from the trained model's weights or parameters. Setting up a federated learning environment, especially with security and privacy guarantees, is a time-consuming process with numerous configurations and parameters that can be manipulated. In order to help clients ensure that collaboration is feasible and to check that it improves their model accuracy, a real-world simulator for privacy-preserving and secure federated learning is required. In this paper, we introduce PrivacyFL, which is an extensible, easily configurable and scalable simulator for federated learning environments. Its key features include latency simulation, robustness to client departure, support for both centralized and decentralized learning, and configurable privacy and security mechanisms based on differential privacy and secure multiparty computation. In this paper, we motivate our research, describe the architecture of the simulator and associated protocols, and discuss its evaluation in numerous scenarios that highlight its wide range of functionality and its advantages. Our paper addresses a significant real-world problem: checking the feasibility of participating in a federated learning environment under a variety of circumstances. It also has a strong practical impact because organizations such as hospitals, banks, and research institutes, which have large amounts of sensitive data and would like to collaborate, would greatly benefit from having a system that enables them to do so in a privacy-preserving and secure manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08423">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 53	Warm Starting Bandits with Side Information from Confounded Data</h3><h4>Nihal Sharma, Soumya Basu, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Sanjay Shakkottai</h4> Abstract: We study a variant of the multi-armed bandit problem where side information in the form of bounds on the mean of each arm is provided. We describe how these bounds on the means can be used efficiently for warm starting bandits. Specifically, we propose the novel UCB-SI algorithm, and illustrate improvements in cumulative regret over the standard UCB algorithm, both theoretically and empirically, in the presence of non-trivial side information. As noted in (Zhang & Bareinboim, 2017), such information arises, for instance, when we have prior logged data on the arms, but this data has been collected under a policy whose choice of arms is based on latent variables to which access is no longer available. We further provide a novel approach for obtaining such bounds from prior partially confounded data under some mild assumptions. We validate our findings through semi-synthetic experiments on data derived from real datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08405">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 54	Keep Doing What Worked: Behavioral Modelling Priors for Offline  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Noah Y. Siegel, Jost Tobias Springenberg, Felix Berkenkamp, Abbas Abdolmaleki, Michael Neunert, Thomas Lampe, Roland Hafner, Martin Riedmiller</h4> Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms promise to be applicable in settings where only a fixed data-set (batch) of environment interactions is available and no new experience can be acquired. This property makes these algorithms appealing for real world problems such as robot control. In practice, however, standard off-policy algorithms fail in the batch setting for continuous control. In this paper, we propose a simple solution to this problem. It admits the use of data generated by arbitrary behavior policies and uses a learned prior -- the advantage-weighted behavior model (ABM) -- to bias the RL policy towards actions that have previously been executed and are likely to be successful on the new task. Our method can be seen as an extension of recent work on batch-RL that enables stable learning from conflicting data-sources. We find improvements on competitive baselines in a variety of RL tasks -- including standard continuous control benchmarks and multi-task learning for simulated and real-world robots. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08396">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 55	Predicting Many Properties of a Quantum System from Very Few  Measurements</h3><h4>Hsin-Yuan Huang, Richard Kueng, John Preskill</h4> Abstract: Predicting properties of complex, large-scale quantum systems is essential for developing quantum technologies. We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a classical shadow, can be used to predict many different properties: order $\log M$ measurements suffice to accurately predict $M$ different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size, and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables, and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians, which allows applications to speedup variational quantum algorithms. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08953">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 56	I-SPEC: An End-to-End Framework for Learning Transportable, Shift-Stable  Models</h3><h4>Adarsh Subbaswamy, Suchi Saria</h4> Abstract: Shifts in environment between development and deployment cause classical supervised learning to produce models that fail to generalize well to new target distributions. Recently, many solutions which find invariant predictive distributions have been developed. Among these, graph-based approaches do not require data from the target environment and can capture more stable information than alternative methods which find stable feature sets. However, these approaches assume that the data generating process is known in the form of a full causal graph, which is generally not the case. In this paper, we propose I-SPEC, an end-to-end framework that addresses this shortcoming by using data to learn a partial ancestral graph (PAG). Using the PAG we develop an algorithm that determines an interventional distribution that is stable to the declared shifts; this subsumes existing approaches which find stable feature sets that are less accurate. We apply I-SPEC to a mortality prediction problem to show it can learn a model that is robust to shifts without needing upfront knowledge of the full causal DAG. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08948">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 57	Implicit differentiation of Lasso-type models for hyperparameter  optimization</h3><h4>Quentin Bertrand, Quentin Klopfenstein, Mathieu Blondel, Samuel Vaiter, Alexandre Gramfort, Joseph Salmon</h4> Abstract: Setting regularization parameters for Lasso-type estimators is notoriously difficult, though crucial in practice. The most popular hyperparameter optimization approach is grid-search using held-out validation data. Grid-search however requires to choose a predefined grid for each parameter, which scales exponentially in the number of parameters. Another approach is to cast hyperparameter optimization as a bi-level optimization problem, one can solve by gradient descent. The key challenge for these methods is the estimation of the gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. Computing this gradient via forward or backward automatic differentiation is possible yet usually suffers from high memory consumption. Alternatively implicit differentiation typically involves solving a linear system which can be prohibitive and numerically unstable in high dimension. In addition, implicit differentiation usually assumes smooth loss functions, which is not the case for Lasso-type problems. This work introduces an efficient implicit differentiation algorithm, without matrix inversion, tailored for Lasso-type problems. Our approach scales to high-dimensional data by leveraging the sparsity of the solutions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a large number of standard methods to optimize the error on held-out data, or the Stein Unbiased Risk Estimator (SURE). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08943">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 58	Wavesplit: End-to-End Speech Separation by Speaker Clustering</h3><h4>Neil Zeghidour, David Grangier</h4> Abstract: We introduce Wavesplit, an end-to-end speech separation system. From a single recording of mixed speech, the model infers and clusters representations of each speaker and then estimates each source signal conditioned on the inferred representations. The model is trained on the raw waveform to jointly perform the two tasks. Our model infers a set of speaker representations through clustering, which addresses the fundamental permutation problem of speech separation. Moreover, the sequence-wide speaker representations provide a more robust separation of long, challenging sequences, compared to previous approaches. We show that Wavesplit outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on clean mixtures of 2 or 3 speakers (WSJ0-2mix, WSJ0-3mix), as well as in noisy (WHAM!) and reverberated (WHAMR!) conditions. As an additional contribution, we further improve our model by introducing online data augmentation for separation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08933">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 59	Imputer: Sequence Modelling via Imputation and Dynamic Programming</h3><h4>William Chan, Chitwan Saharia, Geoffrey Hinton, Mohammad Norouzi, Navdeep Jaitly</h4> Abstract: This paper presents the Imputer, a neural sequence model that generates output sequences iteratively via imputations. The Imputer is an iterative generative model, requiring only a constant number of generation steps independent of the number of input or output tokens. The Imputer can be trained to approximately marginalize over all possible alignments between the input and output sequences, and all possible generation orders. We present a tractable dynamic programming training algorithm, which yields a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. When applied to end-to-end speech recognition, the Imputer outperforms prior non-autoregressive models and achieves competitive results to autoregressive models. On LibriSpeech test-other, the Imputer achieves 11.1 WER, outperforming CTC at 13.0 WER and seq2seq at 12.5 WER. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08926">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 60	How Much Knowledge Can You Pack Into the Parameters of a Language Model?</h3><h4>Adam Roberts, Colin Raffel, Noam Shazeer</h4> Abstract: It has recently been observed that neural language models trained on unstructured text can implicitly store and retrieve knowledge using natural language queries. In this short paper, we measure the practical utility of this approach by fine-tuning pre-trained models to answer questions without access to any external context or knowledge. We show that this approach scales surprisingly well with model size and outperforms models that explicitly look up knowledge on the open-domain variants of Natural Questions and WebQuestions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08910">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 61	REALM: Retrieval-Augmented Language Model Pre-Training</h3><h4>Kelvin Guu, Kenton Lee, Zora Tung, Panupong Pasupat, Ming-Wei Chang</h4> Abstract: Language model pre-training has been shown to capture a surprising amount of world knowledge, crucial for NLP tasks such as question answering. However, this knowledge is stored implicitly in the parameters of a neural network, requiring ever-larger networks to cover more facts. To capture knowledge in a more modular and interpretable way, we augment language model pre-training with a latent knowledge retriever, which allows the model to retrieve and attend over documents from a large corpus such as Wikipedia, used during pre-training, fine-tuning and inference. For the first time, we show how to pre-train such a knowledge retriever in an unsupervised manner, using masked language modeling as the learning signal and backpropagating through a retrieval step that considers millions of documents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Language Model pre-training (REALM) by fine-tuning on the challenging task of Open-domain Question Answering (Open-QA). We compare against state-of-the-art models for both explicit and implicit knowledge storage on three popular Open-QA benchmarks, and find that we outperform all previous methods by a significant margin (4-16% absolute accuracy), while also providing qualitative benefits such as interpretability and modularity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08909">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 62	Second-order Conditional Gradients</h3><h4>Alejandro Carderera, Sebastian Pokutta</h4> Abstract: Constrained second-order convex optimization algorithms are the method of choice when a high accuracy solution to a problem is needed, due to the quadratic convergence rates these methods enjoy when close to the optimum. These algorithms require the solution of a constrained quadratic subproblem at every iteration. In the case where the feasible region can only be accessed efficiently through a linear optimization oracle, and computing first-order information about the function, although possible, is costly, the coupling of constrained second-order and conditional gradient algorithms leads to competitive algorithms with solid theoretical guarantees and good numerical performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08907">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 63	Application of Pre-training Models in Named Entity Recognition</h3><h4>Yu Wang, Yining Sun, Zuchang Ma, Lisheng Gao, Yang Xu, Ting Sun</h4> Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to extract entities from unstructured data. The previous methods for NER were based on machine learning or deep learning. Recently, pre-training models have significantly improved performance on multiple NLP tasks. In this paper, firstly, we introduce the architecture and pre-training tasks of four common pre-training models: BERT, ERNIE, ERNIE2.0-tiny, and RoBERTa. Then, we apply these pre-training models to a NER task by fine-tuning, and compare the effects of the different model architecture and pre-training tasks on the NER task. The experiment results showed that RoBERTa achieved state-of-the-art results on the MSRA-2006 dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08902">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 64	Identifying physical health comorbidities in a cohort of individuals  with severe mental illness: An application of SemEHR</h3><h4>Rebecca Bendayan, Honghan Wu, Zeljko Kraljevic, Robert Stewart, Tom Searle, Jaya Chaturvedi, Jayati Das-Munshi, Zina Ibrahim, Aurelie Mascio, Angus Roberts, Daniel Bean, Richard Dobson</h4> Abstract: Multimorbidity research in mental health services requires data from physical health conditions which is traditionally limited in mental health care electronic health records. In this study, we aimed to extract data from physical health conditions from clinical notes using SemEHR. Data was extracted from Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system at South London and Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre (SLaM BRC) and the cohort consisted of all individuals who had received a primary or secondary diagnosis of severe mental illness between 2007 and 2018. Three pairs of annotators annotated 2403 documents with an average Cohen's Kappa of 0.757. Results show that the NLP performance varies across different diseases areas (F1 0.601 - 0.954) suggesting that the language patterns or terminologies of different condition groups entail different technical challenges to the same NLP task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08901">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 65	SynFi: Automatic Synthetic Fingerprint Generation</h3><h4>M. Sadegh Riazi, Seyed M. Chavoshian, Farinaz Koushanfar</h4> Abstract: Authentication and identification methods based on human fingerprints are ubiquitous in several systems ranging from government organizations to consumer products. The performance and reliability of such systems directly rely on the volume of data on which they have been verified. Unfortunately, a large volume of fingerprint databases is not publicly available due to many privacy and security concerns. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to automatically generate high-fidelity synthetic fingerprints at scale. Our approach relies on (i) Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate the probability distribution of human fingerprints and (ii) Super-Resolution methods to synthesize fine-grained textures. We rigorously test our system and show that our methodology is the first to generate fingerprints that are computationally indistinguishable from real ones, a task that prior art could not accomplish. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08900">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 66	MA-DST: Multi-Attention Based Scalable Dialog State Tracking</h3><h4>Adarsh Kumar, Peter Ku, Anuj Kumar Goyal, Angeliki Metallinou, Dilek Hakkani-Tur</h4> Abstract: Task oriented dialog agents provide a natural language interface for users to complete their goal. Dialog State Tracking (DST), which is often a core component of these systems, tracks the system's understanding of the user's goal throughout the conversation. To enable accurate multi-domain DST, the model needs to encode dependencies between past utterances and slot semantics and understand the dialog context, including long-range cross-domain references. We introduce a novel architecture for this task to encode the conversation history and slot semantics more robustly by using attention mechanisms at multiple granularities. In particular, we use cross-attention to model relationships between the context and slots at different semantic levels and self-attention to resolve cross-domain coreferences. In addition, our proposed architecture does not rely on knowing the domain ontologies beforehand and can also be used in a zero-shot setting for new domains or unseen slot values. Our model improves the joint goal accuracy by 5% (absolute) in the full-data setting and by up to 2% (absolute) in the zero-shot setting over the present state-of-the-art on the MultiWoZ 2.1 dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08898">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 67	Reliable Distributed Clustering with Redundant Data Assignment</h3><h4>Venkata Gandikota, Arya Mazumdar, Ankit Singh Rawat</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present distributed generalized clustering algorithms that can handle large scale data across multiple machines in spite of straggling or unreliable machines. We propose a novel data assignment scheme that enables us to obtain global information about the entire data even when some machines fail to respond with the results of the assigned local computations. The assignment scheme leads to distributed algorithms with good approximation guarantees for a variety of clustering and dimensionality reduction problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08892">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 68	Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning as a Computational Tool for Language  Evolution Research: Historical Context and Future Challenges</h3><h4>Cl√©ment Moulin-Frier, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer</h4> Abstract: Computational models of emergent communication in agent populations are currently gaining interest in the machine learning community due to recent advances in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Current contributions are however still relatively disconnected from the earlier theoretical and computational literature aiming at understanding how language might have emerged from a prelinguistic substance. The goal of this paper is to position recent MARL contributions within the historical context of language evolution research, as well as to extract from this theoretical and computational background a few challenges for future research. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08878">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 69	Halpern Iteration for Near-Optimal and Parameter-Free Monotone Inclusion  and Strong Solutions to Variational Inequalities</h3><h4>Jelena Diakonikolas</h4> Abstract: We leverage the connections between nonexpansive maps, monotone Lipschitz operators, and proximal mappings to obtain near-optimal (i.e., optimal up to poly-log factors in terms of iteration complexity) and parameter-free methods for solving monotone inclusion problems. These results immediately translate into near-optimal guarantees for approximating strong solutions to variational inequality problems, approximating convex-concave min-max optimization problems, and minimizing the norm of the gradient in min-max optimization problems. Our analysis is based on a novel and simple potential-based proof of convergence of Halpern iteration, a classical iteration for finding fixed points of nonexpansive maps. Additionally, we provide a series of algorithmic reductions that highlight connections between different problem classes and lead to lower bounds that certify near-optimality of the studied methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08872">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 70	Fast Differentiable Sorting and Ranking</h3><h4>Mathieu Blondel, Olivier Teboul, Quentin Berthet, Josip Djolonga</h4> Abstract: The sorting operation is one of the most basic and commonly used building blocks in computer programming. In machine learning, it is commonly used for robust statistics. However, seen as a function, it is piecewise linear and as a result includes many kinks at which it is non-differentiable. More problematic is the related ranking operator, commonly used for order statistics and ranking metrics. It is a piecewise constant function, meaning that its derivatives are null or undefined. While numerous works have proposed differentiable proxies to sorting and ranking, they do not achieve the $O(n \log n)$ time complexity one would expect from sorting and ranking operations. In this paper, we propose the first differentiable sorting and ranking operators with $O(n \log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space complexity. Our proposal in addition enjoys exact computation and differentiation. We achieve this feat by constructing differentiable sorting and ranking operators as projections onto the permutahedron, the convex hull of permutations, and using a reduction to isotonic optimization. Empirically, we confirm that our approach is an order of magnitude faster than existing approaches and showcase two novel applications: differentiable Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and soft least trimmed squares. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08871">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 71	Contextual Lensing of Universal Sentence Representations</h3><h4>Jamie Kiros</h4> Abstract: What makes a universal sentence encoder universal? The notion of a generic encoder of text appears to be at odds with the inherent contextualization and non-permanence of language use in a dynamic world. However, mapping sentences into generic fixed-length vectors for downstream similarity and retrieval tasks has been fruitful, particularly for multilingual applications. How do we manage this dilemma? In this work we propose Contextual Lensing, a methodology for inducing context-oriented universal sentence vectors. We break the construction of universal sentence vectors into a core, variable length, sentence matrix representation equipped with an adaptable `lens' from which fixed-length vectors can be induced as a function of the lens context. We show that it is possible to focus notions of language similarity into a small number of lens parameters given a core universal matrix representation. For example, we demonstrate the ability to encode translation similarity of sentences across several languages into a single weight matrix, even when the core encoder has not seen parallel data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08866">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 72	Bounding the expected run-time of nonconvex optimization with early  stopping</h3><h4>Thomas Flynn, Kwang Min Yu, Abid Malik, Nicolas D'Imperio, Shinjae Yoo</h4> Abstract: This work examines the convergence of stochastic gradient-based optimization algorithms that use early stopping based on a validation function. The form of early stopping we consider is that optimization terminates when the norm of the gradient of a validation function falls below a threshold. We derive conditions that guarantee this stopping rule is well-defined, and provide bounds on the expected number of iterations and gradient evaluations needed to meet this criterion. The guarantee accounts for the distance between the training and validation sets, measured with the Wasserstein distance. We develop the approach in the general setting of a first-order optimization algorithm, with possibly biased update directions subject to a geometric drift condition. We then derive bounds on the expected running time for early stopping variants of several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), decentralized SGD (DSGD), and the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. Finally, we consider the generalization properties of the iterate returned by early stopping. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08856">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 73	A General Pairwise Comparison Model for Extremely Sparse Networks</h3><h4>Ruijian Han, Yiming Xu, Kani Chen</h4> Abstract: Statistical inference using pairwise comparison data has been an effective approach to analyzing complex and sparse networks. In this paper we propose a general framework for modeling the mutual interaction in a probabilistic network, which enjoys ample flexibility in terms of parametrization. Within this set-up, we establish that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the latent scores of the subjects is uniformly consistent under a near-minimal condition on network sparsity. This condition is sharp in terms of the leading order asymptotics describing the sparsity. The proof utilizes a novel chaining technique based on the error-induced metric as well as careful counting of comparison graph structures. Our results guarantee that the MLE is a valid estimator for inference in large-scale comparison networks where data is asymptotically deficient. Numerical simulations are provided to complement the theoretical analysis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08853">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 74	Contextual Reserve Price Optimization in Auctions</h3><h4>Joey Huchette, Haihao Lu, Hossein Esfandiari, Vahab Mirrokni</h4> Abstract: We study the problem of learning a linear model to set the reserve price in order to maximize expected revenue in an auction, given contextual information. First, we show that it is not possible to solve this problem in polynomial time unless the \emph{Exponential Time Hypothesis} fails. Second, we present a strong mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for this problem, which is capable of exactly modeling the nonconvex and discontinuous expected reward function. Moreover, we show that this MIP formulation is ideal (the strongest possible formulation) for the revenue function. Since it can be computationally expensive to exactly solve the MIP formulation, we also study the performance of its linear programming (LP) relaxation. We show that, unfortunately, in the worst case the objective gap of the linear programming relaxation can be $O(n)$ times larger than the optimal objective of the actual problem, where $n$ is the number of samples. Finally, we present computational results, showcasing that the mixed-integer programming formulation, along with its linear programming relaxation, are able to superior both the in-sample performance and the out-of-sample performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms on both real and synthetic datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08841">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 75	PA-Cache: Learning-based Popularity-Aware Content Caching in Edge  Networks</h3><h4>Qilin Fan, Jian Li, Xiuhua Li, Qiang He, Shu Fu, Sen Wang</h4> Abstract: With the aggressive growth of smart environments, a large amount of data are generated by edge devices. As a result, content delivery has been quickly pushed to network edges. Compared with classical content delivery networks, edge caches with smaller size usually suffer from more bursty requests, which makes conventional caching algorithms perform poorly in edge networks. This paper aims to propose an effective caching decision policy called PA-Cache that uses evolving deep learning to adaptively learn time-varying content popularity to decide which content to evict when the cache is full. Unlike prior learning-based approaches that either use a small set of features for decision making or require the entire training dataset to be available for learning a fine-tuned but might outdated prediction model, PA-Cache weights a large set of critical features to train the neural network in an evolving manner so as to meet the edge requests with fluctuations and bursts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PA-Cache through extensive experiments with real-world data traces from a large commercial video-on-demand service provider. The evaluation shows that PA-Cache improves the hit rate in comparison with state-of-the-art methods at a lower computational cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08805">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 76	Guiding attention in Sequence-to-sequence models for Dialogue Act  prediction</h3><h4>Pierre Colombo, Emile Chapuis, Matteo Manica, Emmanuel Vignon, Giovanna Varni, Chloe Clavel</h4> Abstract: The task of predicting dialog acts (DA) based on conversational dialog is a key component in the development of conversational agents. Accurately predicting DAs requires a precise modeling of both the conversation and the global tag dependencies. We leverage seq2seq approaches widely adopted in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to improve the modelling of tag sequentiality. Seq2seq models are known to learn complex global dependencies while currently proposed approaches using linear conditional random fields (CRF) only model local tag dependencies. In this work, we introduce a seq2seq model tailored for DA classification using: a hierarchical encoder, a novel guided attention mechanism and beam search applied to both training and inference. Compared to the state of the art our model does not require handcrafted features and is trained end-to-end. Furthermore, the proposed approach achieves an unmatched accuracy score of 85% on SwDA, and state-of-the-art accuracy score of 91.6% on MRDA. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08801">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 77	Pruning untrained neural networks: Principles and Analysis</h3><h4>Soufiane Hayou, Jean-Francois Ton, Arnaud Doucet, Yee Whye Teh</h4> Abstract: Overparameterized neural networks display state-of-the art performance. However, there is a growing need for smaller, energy-efficient, neural networks to be able to use machine learning applications on devices with limited computational resources. A popular approach consists of using pruning techniques. While these techniques have traditionally focused on pruning pre-trained neural networks (e.g. LeCun et al. (1990) and Hassabi et al. (1993)), recent work by Lee et al. (2018) showed promising results where pruning is performed at initialization. However, such procedures remain unsatisfactory as the resulting pruned networks can be difficult to train and, for instance, these procedures do not prevent one layer being fully pruned. In this paper we provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of pruning at initialization and training sparse architectures. This analysis allows us to propose novel principled approaches which we validate experimentally on a variety of network architectures. We particularly show that we can prune up to 99.9% of the weights while keeping the model trainable. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08797">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 78	Do you comply with AI? -- Personalized explanations of learning  algorithms and their impact on employees' compliance behavior</h3><h4>NIklas Kuhl, Jodie Lobana, Christian Meske</h4> Abstract: Machine Learning algorithms are technological key enablers for artificial intelligence (AI). Due to the inherent complexity, these learning algorithms represent black boxes and are difficult to comprehend, therefore influencing compliance behavior. Hence, compliance with the recommendations of such artifacts, which can impact employees' task performance significantly, is still subject to research - and personalization of AI explanations seems to be a promising concept in this regard. In our work, we hypothesize that, based on varying backgrounds like training, domain knowledge and demographic characteristics, individuals have different understandings and hence mental models about the learning algorithm. Personalization of AI explanations, related to the individuals' mental models, may thus be an instrument to affect compliance and therefore employee task performance. Our preliminary results already indicate the importance of personalized explanations in industry settings and emphasize the importance of this research endeavor. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08777">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 79	Propose, Test, Release: Differentially private estimation with high  probability</h3><h4>Victor-Emmanuel Brunel, Marco Avella-Medina</h4> Abstract: We derive concentration inequalities for differentially private median and mean estimators building on the "Propose, Test, Release" (PTR) mechanism introduced by Dwork and Lei (2009). We introduce a new general version of the PTR mechanism that allows us to derive high probability error bounds for differentially private estimators. Our algorithms provide the first statistical guarantees for differentially private estimation of the median and mean without any boundedness assumptions on the data, and without assuming that the target population parameter lies in some known bounded interval. Our procedures do not rely on any truncation of the data and provide the first sub-Gaussian high probability bounds for differentially private median and mean estimation, for possibly heavy tailed random variables. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08774">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 80	Object 6D Pose Estimation with Non-local Attention</h3><h4>Jianhan Mei, Henghui Ding, Xudong Jiang</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of estimating 6D object pose from a single RGB image.

<h3>No. 81	APTER: Aggregated Prognosis Through Exponential Reweighting</h3><h4>Kristiaan Pelckmans, Liu Yang</h4> Abstract: This paper considers the task of learning how to make a prognosis of a patient based on his/her micro-array expression levels. The method is an application of the aggregation method as recently proposed in the literature on theoretical machine learning, and excels in its computational convenience and capability to deal with high-dimensional data. A formal analysis of the method is given, yielding rates of convergence similar to what traditional techniques obtain, while it is shown to cope well with an exponentially large set of features. Those results are supported by numerical simulations on a range of publicly available survival-micro-array datasets. It is empirically found that the proposed technique combined with a recently proposed preprocessing technique gives excellent performances. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08731">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 82	A survey on Semi-, Self- and Unsupervised Techniques in Image  Classification</h3><h4>Lars Schmarje, Monty Santarossa, Simon-Martin Schr√∂der, Reinhard Koch</h4> Abstract: While deep learning strategies achieve outstanding results in computer vision tasks, one issue remains. The current strategies rely heavily on a huge amount of labeled data. In many real-world problems it is not feasible to create such an amount of labeled training data. Therefore, researchers try to incorporate unlabeled data into the training process to reach equal results with fewer labels. Due to a lot of concurrent research, it is difficult to keep track of recent developments. In this survey we provide an overview of often used techniques and methods in image classification with fewer labels. We compare 21 methods. In our analysis we identify three major trends. 1. State-of-the-art methods are scaleable to real world applications based on their accuracy. 2. The degree of supervision which is needed to achieve comparable results to the usage of all labels is decreasing. 3. All methods share common techniques while only few methods combine these techniques to achieve better performance. Based on all of these three trends we discover future research opportunities. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08721">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 83	Automatic Gesture Recognition in Robot-assisted Surgery with  Reinforcement Learning and Tree Search</h3><h4>Xiaojie Gao, Yueming Jin, Qi Dou, Pheng-Ann Heng</h4> Abstract: Automatic surgical gesture recognition is fundamental for improving intelligence in robot-assisted surgery, such as conducting complicated tasks of surgery surveillance and skill evaluation. However, current methods treat each frame individually and produce the outcomes without effective consideration on future information. In this paper, we propose a framework based on reinforcement learning and tree search for joint surgical gesture segmentation and classification. An agent is trained to segment and classify the surgical video in a human-like manner whose direct decisions are re-considered by tree search appropriately. Our proposed tree search algorithm unites the outputs from two designed neural networks, i.e., policy and value network. With the integration of complementary information from distinct models, our framework is able to achieve the better performance than baseline methods using either of the neural networks. For an overall evaluation, our developed approach consistently outperforms the existing methods on the suturing task of JIGSAWS dataset in terms of accuracy, edit score and F1 score. Our study highlights the utilization of tree search to refine actions in reinforcement learning framework for surgical robotic applications. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08718">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 84	An empirical study of Conv-TasNet</h3><h4>Berkan Kadioglu, Michael Horgan, Xiaoyu Liu, Jordi Pons, Dan Darcy, Vivek Kumar</h4> Abstract: Conv-TasNet is a recently proposed waveform-based deep neural network that achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech source separation. Its architecture consists of a learnable encoder/decoder and a separator that operates on top of this learned space. Various improvements have been proposed to Conv-TasNet. However, they mostly focus on the separator, leaving its encoder/decoder as a (shallow) linear operator. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study of Conv-TasNet and propose an enhancement to the encoder/decoder that is based on a (deep) non-linear variant of it. In addition, we experiment with the larger and more diverse LibriTTS dataset and investigate the generalization capabilities of the studied models when trained on a much larger dataset. We propose cross-dataset evaluation that includes assessing separations from the WSJ0-2mix, LibriTTS and VCTK databases. Our results show that enhancements to the encoder/decoder can improve average SI-SNR performance by more than 1 dB. Furthermore, we offer insights into the generalization capabilities of Conv-TasNet and the potential value of improvements to the encoder/decoder. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08688">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 85	Learning Gaussian Graphical Models via Multiplicative Weights</h3><h4>Anamay Chaturvedi, Jonathan Scarlett</h4> Abstract: Graphical model selection in Markov random fields is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning. Two particularly prominent models, the Ising model and Gaussian model, have largely developed in parallel using different (though often related) techniques, and several practical algorithms with rigorous sample complexity bounds have been established for each. In this paper, we adapt a recently proposed algorithm of Klivans and Meka (FOCS, 2017), based on the method of multiplicative weight updates, from the Ising model to the Gaussian model, via non-trivial modifications to both the algorithm and its analysis. The algorithm enjoys a sample complexity bound that is qualitatively similar to others in the literature, has a low runtime $O(mp^2)$ in the case of $m$ samples and $p$ nodes, and can trivially be implemented in an online manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08663">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 86	Computational Design with Crowds</h3><h4>Yuki Koyama, Takeo Igarashi</h4> Abstract: Computational design is aimed at supporting or automating design processes using computational techniques. However, some classes of design tasks involve criteria that are difficult to handle only with computers. For example, visual design tasks seeking to fulfill aesthetic goals are difficult to handle purely with computers. One promising approach is to leverage human computation; that is, to incorporate human input into the computation process. Crowdsourcing platforms provide a convenient way to integrate such human computation into a working system. In this chapter, we discuss such computational design with crowds in the domain of parameter tweaking tasks in visual design. Parameter tweaking is often performed to maximize the aesthetic quality of designed objects. Computational design powered by crowds can solve this maximization problem by leveraging human computation. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of computational design with crowds with two illustrative examples: (1) estimating the objective function (specifically, preference learning from crowds' pairwise comparisons) to facilitate interactive design exploration by a designer and (2) directly searching for the optimal parameter setting that maximizes the objective function (specifically, crowds-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08657">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 87	Balancing Cost and Benefit with Tied-Multi Transformers</h3><h4>Raj Dabre, Raphael Rubino, Atsushi Fujita</h4> Abstract: We propose and evaluate a novel procedure for training multiple Transformers with tied parameters which compresses multiple models into one enabling the dynamic choice of the number of encoder and decoder layers during decoding. In sequence-to-sequence modeling, typically, the output of the last layer of the N-layer encoder is fed to the M-layer decoder, and the output of the last decoder layer is used to compute loss. Instead, our method computes a single loss consisting of NxM losses, where each loss is computed from the output of one of the M decoder layers connected to one of the N encoder layers. Such a model subsumes NxM models with different number of encoder and decoder layers, and can be used for decoding with fewer than the maximum number of encoder and decoder layers. We then propose a mechanism to choose a priori the number of encoder and decoder layers for faster decoding, and also explore recurrent stacking of layers and knowledge distillation for model compression. We present a cost-benefit analysis of applying the proposed approaches for neural machine translation and show that they reduce decoding costs while preserving translation quality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08614">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 88	KaoKore: A Pre-modern Japanese Art Facial Expression Dataset</h3><h4>Yingtao Tian, Chikahiko Suzuki, Tarin Clanuwat, Mikel Bober-Irizar, Alex Lamb, Asanobu Kitamoto</h4> Abstract: From classifying handwritten digits to generating strings of text, the datasets which have received long-time focus from the machine learning community vary greatly in their subject matter. This has motivated a renewed interest in building datasets which are socially and culturally relevant, so that algorithmic research may have a more direct and immediate impact on society. One such area is in history and the humanities, where better and relevant machine learning models can accelerate research across various fields. To this end, newly released benchmarks and models have been proposed for transcribing historical Japanese cursive writing, yet for the field as a whole using machine learning for historical Japanese artworks still remains largely uncharted. To bridge this gap, in this work we propose a new dataset KaoKore which consists of faces extracted from pre-modern Japanese artwork. We demonstrate its value as both a dataset for image classification as well as a creative and artistic dataset, which we explore using generative models.

<h3>No. 89	Syndrome-aware Herb Recommendation with Multi-Graph Convolution Network</h3><h4>Yuanyuan Jin, Wei Zhang, Xiangnan He, Xinyu Wang, Xiaoling Wang</h4> Abstract: Herb recommendation plays a crucial role in the therapeutic process of Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM), which aims to recommend a set of herbs to treat the symptoms of a patient. While several machine learning methods have been developed for herb recommendation, they are limited in modeling only the interactions between herbs and symptoms, and ignoring the intermediate process of syndrome induction. When performing TCM diagnostics, an experienced doctor typically induces syndromes from the patient's symptoms and then suggests herbs based on the induced syndromes. As such, we believe the induction of syndromes, an overall description of the symptoms, is important for herb recommendation and should be properly handled. However, due to the ambiguity and complexity of syndrome induction, most prescriptions lack the explicit ground truth of syndromes. In this paper, we propose a new method that takes the implicit syndrome induction process into account for herb recommendation. Given a set of symptoms to treat, we aim to generate an overall syndrome representation by effectively fusing the embeddings of all the symptoms in the set, to mimic how a doctor induces the syndromes. Towards symptom embedding learning, we additionally construct a symptom-symptom graph from the input prescriptions for capturing the relations between symptoms; we then build graph convolution networks(GCNs) on both symptom-symptom and symptom-herb graphs to learn symptom embedding. Similarly, we construct a herb-herb graph and build GCNs on both herb-herb and symptom-herb graphs to learn herb embedding, which is finally interacted with the syndrome representation to predict the scores of herbs. In this way, more comprehensive representations can be obtained. We conduct extensive experiments on a public TCM dataset, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art herb recommendation methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08575">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 90	The continuous categorical: a novel simplex-valued exponential family</h3><h4>Elliott Gordon-Rodriguez, Gabriel Loaiza-Ganem, John P. Cunningham</h4> Abstract: Simplex-valued data appear throughout statistics and machine learning, for example in the context of transfer learning and compression of deep networks. Existing models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data - the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08563">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 91	Federated pretraining and fine tuning of BERT using clinical notes from  multiple silos</h3><h4>Dianbo Liu, Tim Miller</h4> Abstract: Large scale contextual representation models, such as BERT, have significantly advanced natural language processing (NLP) in recently years. However, in certain area like healthcare, accessing diverse large scale text data from multiple institutions is extremely challenging due to privacy and regulatory reasons. In this article, we show that it is possible to both pretrain and fine tune BERT models in a federated manner using clinical texts from different silos without moving the data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08562">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 92	Learning to Walk in the Real World with Minimal Human Effort</h3><h4>Sehoon Ha, Peng Xu, Zhenyu Tan, Sergey Levine, Jie Tan</h4> Abstract: Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental challenges for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged as a promising method for developing such control policies autonomously. In this paper, we develop a system for learning legged locomotion policies with deep RL in the real world with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for on-robot learning systems are automatic data collection and safety. We overcome these two challenges by developing a multi-task learning procedure, an automatic reset controller, and a safety-constrained RL framework. We tested our system on the task of learning to walk on three different terrains: flat ground, a soft mattress, and a doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently learn locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08550">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 93	Do We Really Need to Access the Source Data? Source Hypothesis Transfer  for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Jian Liang, Dapeng Hu, Jiashi Feng</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to leverage the knowledge learned from a labeled source dataset to solve similar tasks in a new unlabeled domain. Prior UDA methods typically require to access the source data when learning to adapt the model, making them risky and inefficient for decentralized private data. In this work we tackle a novel setting where only a trained source model is available and investigate how we can effectively utilize such a model without source data to solve UDA problems. To this end, we propose a simple yet generic representation learning framework, named \emph{Source HypOthesis Transfer} (SHOT). Specifically, SHOT freezes the classifier module (hypothesis) of the source model and learns the target-specific feature extraction module by exploiting both information maximization and self-supervised pseudo-labeling to implicitly align representations from the target domains to the source hypothesis. In this way, the learned target model can directly predict the labels of target data. We further investigate several techniques to refine the network architecture to parameterize the source model for better transfer performance. To verify its versatility, we evaluate SHOT in a variety of adaptation cases including closed-set, partial-set, and open-set domain adaptation. Experiments indicate that SHOT yields state-of-the-art results among multiple domain adaptation benchmarks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08546">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 94	A Scalable Framework for Sparse Clustering Without Shrinkage</h3><h4>Zhiyue Zhang, Kenneth Lange, Jason Xu</h4> Abstract: Clustering, a fundamental activity in unsupervised learning, is notoriously difficult when the feature space is high-dimensional. Fortunately, in many realistic scenarios, only a handful of features are relevant in distinguishing clusters. This has motivated the development of sparse clustering techniques that typically rely on k-means within outer algorithms of high computational complexity. Current techniques also require careful tuning of shrinkage parameters, further limiting their scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for sparse k-means clustering that is intuitive, simple to implement, and competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms. We show that our algorithm enjoys consistency and convergence guarantees. Our core method readily generalizes to several task-specific algorithms such as clustering on subsets of attributes and in partially observed data settings. We showcase these contributions via simulated experiments and benchmark datasets, as well as a case study on mouse protein expression. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08541">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 95	Adaptive Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation</h3><h4>Tao Sun, Han Shen, Tianyi Chen, Dongsheng Li</h4> Abstract: This paper revisits the celebrated temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm for the policy evaluation in reinforcement learning. Typically, the performance of the plain-vanilla TD algorithm is sensitive to the choice of stepsizes. Oftentimes, TD suffers from slow convergence. Motivated by the tight connection between the TD learning algorithm and the stochastic gradient methods, we develop the first adaptive variant of the TD learning algorithm with linear function approximation that we term AdaTD. In contrast to the original TD, AdaTD is robust or less sensitive to the choice of stepsizes. Analytically, we establish that to reach an $\epsilon$ accuracy, the number of iterations needed is $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^2\ln^4\frac{1}{\epsilon}/\ln^4\frac{1}{\rho})$, where $\rho$ represents the speed of the underlying Markov chain converges to the stationary distribution. This implies that the iteration complexity of AdaTD is no worse than that of TD in the worst case. Going beyond TD, we further develop an adaptive variant of TD($\lambda$), which is referred to as AdaTD($\lambda$). We evaluate the empirical performance of AdaTD and AdaTD($\lambda$) on several standard reinforcement learning tasks in OpenAI Gym on both linear and nonlinear function approximation, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approaches over existing ones. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08537">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 96	Towards Physically-consistent, Data-driven Models of Convection</h3><h4>Tom Beucler, Michael Pritchard, Pierre Gentine, Stephan Rasp</h4> Abstract: Data-driven algorithms, in particular neural networks, can emulate the effect of sub-grid scale processes in coarse-resolution climate models if trained on high-resolution climate simulations. However, they may violate key physical constraints and lack the ability to generalize outside of their training set. Here, we show that physical constraints can be enforced in neural networks, either approximately by adapting the loss function or to machine precision by adapting the architecture. As these physical constraints are insufficient to guarantee generalizability, we additionally propose a framework to find physical normalizations that can be applied to the training and validation data to improve the ability of neural networks to generalize to unseen climates. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 97	Pulsars Detection by Machine Learning with Very Few Features</h3><h4>Haitao Lin, Xiangru Li, Ziying Luo</h4> Abstract: It is an active topic to investigate the schemes based on machine learning (ML) methods for detecting pulsars as the data volume growing exponentially in modern surveys. To improve the detection performance, input features into an ML model should be investigated specifically. In the existing pulsar detection researches based on ML methods, there are mainly two kinds of feature designs: the empirical features and statistical features. Due to the combinational effects from multiple features, however, there exist some redundancies and even irrelevant components in the available features, which can reduce the accuracy of a pulsar detection model. Therefore, it is essential to select a subset of relevant features from a set of available candidate features and known as {\itshape feature selection.} In this work, two feature selection algorithms ----\textit{Grid Search} (GS) and \textit{Recursive Feature Elimination} (RFE)---- are proposed to improve the detection performance by removing the redundant and irrelevant features. The algorithms were evaluated on the Southern High Time Resolution University survey (HTRU-S) with five pulsar detection models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed feature selection algorithms. By the GS, a model with only two features reach a recall rate as high as 99\% and a false positive rate (FPR) as low as 0.65\%; By the RFE, another model with only three features achieves a recall rate 99\% and an FPR of 0.16\% in pulsar candidates classification. Furthermore, this work investigated the number of features required as well as the misclassified pulsars by our models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08519">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 98	Causal Inference under Networked Interference</h3><h4>Yunpu Ma, Yuyi Wang, Volker Tresp</h4> Abstract: Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments or observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment responses under interference. Hence, how to estimate the superimposed causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference becomes a challenging task in causal inference. In this work, we study causal effect estimation under general network interference using GNNs, which are powerful tools for capturing the dependency in the graph. After deriving causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference and treatment capacity constraint. Furthermore, a heuristic graph structure-dependent error bound for GNN-based causal estimators is provided. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08506">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 99	Stochastic Regret Minimization in Extensive-Form Games</h3><h4>Gabriele Farina, Christian Kroer, Tuomas Sandholm</h4> Abstract: Monte-Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for solving sequential games that are too large for full tree traversals. It works by using gradient estimates that can be computed via sampling. However, stochastic methods for sequential games have not been investigated extensively beyond MCCFR. In this paper we develop a new framework for developing stochastic regret minimization methods. This framework allows us to use any regret-minimization algorithm, coupled with any gradient estimator. The MCCFR algorithm can be analyzed as a special case of our framework, and this analysis leads to significantly-stronger theoretical on convergence, while simultaneously yielding a simplified proof. Our framework allows us to instantiate several new stochastic methods for solving sequential games. We show extensive experiments on three games, where some variants of our methods outperform MCCFR. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08493">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 100	Entrywise convergence of iterative methods for eigenproblems</h3><h4>Vasileios Charisopoulos, Austin R. Benson, Anil Damle</h4> Abstract: Several problems in machine learning, statistics, and other fields rely on computing eigenvectors. For large scale problems, the computation of these eigenvectors is typically performed via iterative schemes such as subspace iteration or Krylov methods. While there is classical and comprehensive analysis for subspace convergence guarantees with respect to the spectral norm, in many modern applications other notions of subspace distance are more appropriate. Recent theoretical work has focused on perturbations of subspaces measured in the $\ell_{2 \to \infty}$ norm, but does not consider the actual computation of eigenvectors. Here we address the convergence of subspace iteration when distances are measured in the $\ell_{2 \to \infty}$ norm and provide deterministic bounds. We complement our analysis with a practical stopping criterion and demonstrate its applicability via numerical experiments. Our results show that one can get comparable performance on downstream tasks while requiring fewer iterations, thereby saving substantial computational time. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08491">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 101	The Information in Emotion Communication</h3><h4>Alison Duncan Kerr, Kevin Scharp</h4> Abstract: How much information is transmitted when animals use emotions to communicate? It is clear that emotions are used as communication systems in humans and other species. The quantitative theory of emotion information presented here is based on Shannon's mathematical theory of information in communication systems. The theory explains myriad aspects of emotion communication and offers dozens of new directions for research. It is superior to the "contagion" theory of emotion spreading, which is currently dominant. One important application of the information theory of emotion communication is that it permits the development of emotion security systems for social networks to guard against the widespread emotion manipulation we see online today. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08470">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 102	Descriptive and Predictive Analysis of Euroleague Basketball Games and  the Wisdom of Basketball Crowds</h3><h4>Georgios Giasemidis</h4> Abstract: In this study we focus on the prediction of basketball games in the Euroleague competition using machine learning modelling. The prediction is a binary classification problem, predicting whether a match finishes 1 (home win) or 2 (away win). Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the "wisdom of the basketball crowd" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study. We argue why the accuracy level of this group of "experts" should be set as the benchmark for future studies in the prediction of (European) basketball games using machine learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08465">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 103	From Poincar√© Recurrence to Convergence in Imperfect Information  Games: Finding Equilibrium via Regularization</h3><h4>Julien Perolat, Remi Munos, Jean-Baptiste Lespiau, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Mark Rowland, Pedro Ortega, Neil Burch, Thomas Anthony, David Balduzzi, Bart De Vylder, Georgios Piliouras, Marc Lanctot, Karl Tuyls</h4> Abstract: In this paper we investigate the Follow the Regularized Leader dynamics in sequential imperfect information games (IIG). We generalize existing results of Poincar\'e recurrence from normal-form games to zero-sum two-player imperfect information games and other sequential game settings. We then investigate how adapting the reward (by adding a regularization term) of the game can give strong convergence guarantees in monotone games. We continue by showing how this reward adaptation technique can be leveraged to build algorithms that converge exactly to the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we show how these insights can be directly used to build state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for zero-sum two-player Imperfect Information Games (IIG). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08456">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 104	SD-GAN: Structural and Denoising GAN reveals facial parts under  occlusion</h3><h4>Samik Banerjee, Sukhendu Das</h4> Abstract: Certain facial parts are salient (unique) in appearance, which substantially contribute to the holistic recognition of a subject. Occlusion of these salient parts deteriorates the performance of face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generative model to reconstruct the missing parts of the face which are under occlusion. The proposed generative model (SD-GAN) reconstructs a face preserving the illumination variation and identity of the face. A novel adversarial training algorithm has been designed for a bimodal mutually exclusive Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, for faster convergence. A novel adversarial "structural" loss function is also proposed, comprising of two components: a holistic and a local loss, characterized by SSIM and patch-wise MSE. Ablation studies on real and synthetically occluded face datasets reveal that our proposed technique outperforms the competing methods by a considerable margin, even for boosting the performance of Face Recognition. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08448">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 105	Simultaneous Inference for Massive Data: Distributed Bootstrap</h3><h4>Yang Yu, Shih-Kang Chao, Guang Cheng</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a bootstrap method applied to massive data processed distributedly in a large number of machines. This new method is computationally efficient in that we bootstrap on the master machine without over-resampling, typically required by existing methods \cite{kleiner2014scalable,sengupta2016subsampled}, while provably achieving optimal statistical efficiency with minimal communication. Our method does not require repeatedly re-fitting the model but only applies multiplier bootstrap in the master machine on the gradients received from the worker machines. Simulations validate our theory. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08443">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 106	Fine tuning U-Net for ultrasound image segmentation: which layers?</h3><h4>Mina Amiri, Rupert Brooks, Hassan Rivaz</h4> Abstract: Fine-tuning a network which has been trained on a large dataset is an alternative to full training in order to overcome the problem of scarce and expensive data in medical applications. While the shallow layers of the network are usually kept unchanged, deeper layers are modified according to the new dataset. This approach may not work for ultrasound images due to their drastically different appearance. In this study, we investigated the effect of fine-tuning different layers of a U-Net which was trained on segmentation of natural images in breast ultrasound image segmentation. Tuning the contracting part and fixing the expanding part resulted in substantially better results compared to fixing the contracting part and tuning the expanding part. Furthermore, we showed that starting to fine-tune the U-Net from the shallow layers and gradually including more layers will lead to a better performance compared to fine-tuning the network from the deep layers moving back to shallow layers. We did not observe the same results on segmentation of X-ray images, which have different salient features compared to ultrasound, it may therefore be more appropriate to fine-tune the shallow layers rather than deep layers. Shallow layers learn lower level features (including speckle pattern, and probably the noise and artifact properties) which are critical in automatic segmentation in this modality. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08438">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 107	Residual Bootstrap Exploration for Bandit Algorithms</h3><h4>Chi-Hua Wang, Yang Yu, Botao Hao, Guang Cheng</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel perturbation-based exploration method in bandit algorithms with bounded or unbounded rewards, called residual bootstrap exploration (\texttt{ReBoot}). The \texttt{ReBoot} enforces exploration by injecting data-driven randomness through a residual-based perturbation mechanism. This novel mechanism captures the underlying distributional properties of fitting errors, and more importantly boosts exploration to escape from suboptimal solutions (for small sample sizes) by inflating variance level in an \textit{unconventional} way. In theory, with appropriate variance inflation level, \texttt{ReBoot} provably secures instance-dependent logarithmic regret in Gaussian multi-armed bandits. We evaluate the \texttt{ReBoot} in different synthetic multi-armed bandits problems and observe that the \texttt{ReBoot} performs better for unbounded rewards and more robustly than \texttt{Giro} \cite{kveton2018garbage} and \texttt{PHE} \cite{kveton2019perturbed}, with comparable computational efficiency to the Thompson sampling method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08436">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 108	Weakly-supervised Multi-output Regression via Correlated Gaussian  Processes</h3><h4>Seokhyun Chung, Raed Al Kontar, Zhenke Wu</h4> Abstract: Multi-output regression seeks to infer multiple latent functions using data from multiple groups/sources while accounting for potential between-group similarities. In this paper, we consider multi-output regression under a weakly-supervised setting where a subset of data points from multiple groups are unlabeled. We use dependent Gaussian processes for multiple outputs constructed by convolutions with shared latent processes. We introduce hyperpriors for the multinomial probabilities of the unobserved labels and optimize the hyperparameters which we show improves estimation. We derive two variational bounds: (i) a modified variational bound for fast and stable convergence in model inference, (ii) a scalable variational bound that is amenable to stochastic optimization. We use experiments on synthetic and real-world data to show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models with more accurate estimation of multiple latent functions and unobserved labels. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08412">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 109	A Unified Framework for Gaussian Mixture Reduction with Composite  Transportation Distance</h3><h4>Qiong Zhang, Jiahua Chen</h4> Abstract: Gaussian mixture reduction (GMR) is the problem of approximating a finite Gaussian mixture by one with fewer components. It is widely used in density estimation, nonparametric belief propagation, and Bayesian recursive filtering. Although optimization and clustering-based algorithms have been proposed for GMR, they are either computationally expensive or lacking in theoretical supports. In this work, we propose to perform GMR by minimizing the entropic regularized composite transportation distance between two mixtures. We show our approach provides a unified framework for GMR that is both interpretable and computationally efficient. Our work also bridges the gap between optimization and clustering-based approaches for GMR. A Majorization-Minimization algorithm is developed for our optimization problem and its theoretical convergence is also established in this paper. Empirical experiments are also conducted to show the effectiveness of GMR. The effect of the choice of transportation cost on the performance of GMR is also investigated. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08410">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 110	Implicit Regularization of Random Feature Models</h3><h4>Arthur Jacot, Berfin ≈ûim≈üek, Francesco Spadaro, Cl√©ment Hongler, Franck Gabriel</h4> Abstract: Random Feature (RF) models are used as efficient parametric approximations of kernel methods. We investigate, by means of random matrix theory, the connection between Gaussian RF models and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR). For a Gaussian RF model with $P$ features, $N$ data points, and a ridge $\lambda$, we show that the average (i.e. expected) RF predictor is close to a KRR predictor with an effective ridge $\tilde{\lambda}$. We show that $\tilde{\lambda} > \lambda$ and $\tilde{\lambda} \searrow \lambda$ monotonically as $P$ grows, thus revealing the implicit regularization effect of finite RF sampling. We then compare the risk (i.e. test error) of the $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor with the average risk of the $\lambda$-RF predictor and obtain a precise and explicit bound on their difference. Finally, we empirically find an extremely good agreement between the test errors of the average $\lambda$-RF predictor and $\tilde{\lambda}$-KRR predictor. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08404">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 111	MonoLayout: Amodal scene layout from a single image</h3><h4>Kaustubh Mani, Swapnil Daga, Shubhika Garg, N. Sai Shankar, Krishna Murthy Jatavallabhula, K. Madhava Krishna</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we address the novel, highly challenging problem of estimating the layout of a complex urban driving scenario. Given a single color image captured from a driving platform, we aim to predict the bird's-eye view layout of the road and other traffic participants. The estimated layout should reason beyond what is visible in the image, and compensate for the loss of 3D information due to projection. We dub this problem amodal scene layout estimation, which involves "hallucinating" scene layout for even parts of the world that are occluded in the image. To this end, we present MonoLayout, a deep neural network for real-time amodal scene layout estimation from a single image. We represent scene layout as a multi-channel semantic occupancy grid, and leverage adversarial feature learning to hallucinate plausible completions for occluded image parts. Due to the lack of fair baseline methods, we extend several state-of-the-art approaches for road-layout estimation and vehicle occupancy estimation in bird's-eye view to the amodal setup for rigorous evaluation. By leveraging temporal sensor fusion to generate training labels, we significantly outperform current art over a number of datasets. On the KITTI and Argoverse datasets, we outperform all baselines by a significant margin. We also make all our annotations, and code publicly available.

<h3>No. 112	Comparative Visual Analytics for Assessing Medical Records with Sequence  Embedding</h3><h4>Rongchen Guo, Takanori Fujiwara, Yiran Li, Kelly M. Lima, Soman Sen, Nam K. Tran, Kwan-Liu Ma</h4> Abstract: Machine learning for data-driven diagnosis has been actively studied in medicine to provide better healthcare. Supporting analysis of a patient cohort similar to a patient under treatment is a key task for clinicians to make decisions with high confidence. However, such analysis is not straightforward due to the characteristics of medical records: high dimensionality, irregularity in time, and sparsity. To address this challenge, we introduce a method for similarity calculation of medical records. Our method employs event and sequence embeddings. While we use an autoencoder for the event embedding, we apply its variant with the self-attention mechanism for the sequence embedding. Moreover, in order to better handle the irregularity of data, we enhance the self-attention mechanism with consideration of different time intervals. We have developed a visual analytics system to support comparative studies of patient records. To make a comparison of sequences with different lengths easier, our system incorporates a sequence alignment method. Through its interactive interface, the user can quickly identify patients of interest and conveniently review both the temporal and multivariate aspects of the patient records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our design and system with case studies using a real-world dataset from the neonatal intensive care unit of UC Davis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08356">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 113	Optimal Multiple Stopping Rule for Warm-Starting Sequential Selection</h3><h4>Mathilde Fekom, Nicolas Vayatis, Argyris Kalogeratos</h4> Abstract: In this paper we present the Warm-starting Dynamic Thresholding algorithm, developed using dynamic programming, for a variant of the standard online selection problem. The problem allows job positions to be either free or already occupied at the beginning of the process. Throughout the selection process, the decision maker interviews one after the other the new candidates and reveals a quality score for each of them. Based on that information, she can (re)assign each job at most once by taking immediate and irrevocable decisions. We relax the hard requirement of the class of dynamic programming algorithms to perfectly know the distribution from which the scores of candidates are drawn, by presenting extensions for the partial and no-information cases, in which the decision maker can learn the underlying score distribution sequentially while interviewing candidates. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.05160">PDF</a><h2>2020-02-21</h2>
<h3>No. 1	On Adaptive Attacks to Adversarial Example Defenses</h3><h4>Florian Tramer, Nicholas Carlini, Wieland Brendel, Aleksander Madry</h4> Abstract: Adaptive attacks have (rightfully) become the de facto standard for evaluating defenses to adversarial examples. We find, however, that typical adaptive evaluations are incomplete. We demonstrate that thirteen defenses recently published at ICLR, ICML and NeurIPS---and chosen for illustrative and pedagogical purposes---can be circumvented despite attempting to perform evaluations using adaptive attacks. While prior evaluation papers focused mainly on the end result---showing that a defense was ineffective---this paper focuses on laying out the methodology and the approach necessary to perform an adaptive attack. We hope that these analyses will serve as guidance on how to properly perform adaptive attacks against defenses to adversarial examples, and thus will allow the community to make further progress in building more robust models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08347">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Schoenberg-Rao distances: Entropy-based and geometry-aware statistical  Hilbert distances</h3><h4>Ga√´tan Hadjeres, Frank Nielsen</h4> Abstract: Distances between probability distributions that take into account the geometry of their sample space,like the Wasserstein or the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances have received a lot of attention in machine learning as they can, for instance, be used to compare probability distributions with disjoint supports. In this paper, we study a class of statistical Hilbert distances that we term the Schoenberg-Rao distances, a generalization of the MMD that allows one to consider a broader class of kernels, namely the conditionally negative semi-definite kernels. In particular, we introduce a principled way to construct such kernels and derive novel closed-form distances between mixtures of Gaussian distributions, among others. These distances, derived from the concave Rao's quadratic entropy, enjoy nice theoretical properties and possess interpretable hyperparameters which can be tuned for specific applications. Our method constitutes a practical alternative to Wasserstein distances and we illustrate its efficiency on a broad range of machine learning tasks such as density estimation, generative modeling and mixture simplification. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08345">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	NeuroFabric: Identifying Ideal Topologies for Training A Priori Sparse  Networks</h3><h4>Mihailo Isakov, Michel A. Kinsy</h4> Abstract: Long training times of deep neural networks are a bottleneck in machine learning research. The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic growth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional layers with respect to their information bandwidth. Recently, training `a priori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to retain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low. However, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks is unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of intra-layer topology. First, we derive a new sparse neural network initialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse networks. Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar topologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy. To explain these differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a topology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on. We then derive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single topology that satisfies all of them. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08339">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoder using Metamorphic Truth  and Imputation Feedback</h3><h4>Haw-minn Lu (1), Giancarlo Perrone (1), Jos√© Unpingco (1) ((1) Gary and Mary West Health Institute)</h4> Abstract: Although data may be abundant, complete data is less so, due to missing columns or rows. This missingness undermines the performance of downstream data products that either omit incomplete cases or create derived completed data for subsequent processing. Appropriately managing missing data is required in order to fully exploit and correctly use data. We propose a Multiple Imputation model using Denoising Autoencoders to learn the internal representation of data. Furthermore, we use the novel mechanisms of Metamorphic Truth and Imputation Feedback to maintain statistical integrity of attributes and eliminate bias in the learning process. Our approach explores the effects of imputation on various missingness mechanisms and patterns of missing data, outperforming other methods in many standard test cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08338">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Value-driven Hindsight Modelling</h3><h4>Arthur Guez, Fabio Viola, Th√©ophane Weber, Lars Buesing, Steven Kapturowski, Doina Precup, David Silver, Nicolas Heess</h4> Abstract: Value estimation is a critical component of the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The question of how to effectively learn predictors for value from data is one of the major problems studied by the RL community, and different approaches exploit structure in the problem domain in different ways. Model learning can make use of the rich transition structure present in sequences of observations, but this approach is usually not sensitive to the reward function. In contrast, model-free methods directly leverage the quantity of interest from the future but have to compose with a potentially weak scalar signal (an estimate of the return). In this paper we develop an approach for representation learning in RL that sits in between these two extremes: we propose to learn what to model in a way that can directly help value prediction. To this end we determine which features of the future trajectory provide useful information to predict the associated return. This provides us with tractable prediction targets that are directly relevant for a task, and can thus accelerate learning of the value function. The idea can be understood as reasoning, in hindsight, about which aspects of the future observations could help past value prediction. We show how this can help dramatically even in simple policy evaluation settings. We then test our approach at scale in challenging domains, including on 57 Atari 2600 games. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08329">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Variational Encoder-based Reliable Classification</h3><h4>Chitresh Bhushan, Zhaoyuan Yang, Nurali Virani, Naresh Iyer</h4> Abstract: Machine learning models provide statistically impressive results which might be individually unreliable. To provide reliability, we propose an Epistemic Classifier (EC) that can provide justification of its belief using support from the training dataset as well as quality of reconstruction. Our approach is based on modified variational auto-encoders that can identify a semantically meaningful low-dimensional space where perceptually similar instances are close in $\ell_2$-distance too. Our results demonstrate improved reliability of predictions and robust identification of samples with adversarial attacks as compared to baseline of softmax-based thresholding. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08289">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Outcome Correlation in Graph Neural Network Regression</h3><h4>Junteng Jia, Austin Benson</h4> Abstract: Graph neural networks aggregate features in vertex neighborhoods to learn vector representations of all vertices, using supervision from some labeled vertices during training. The predictor is then a function of the vector representation, and predictions are made independently on unlabeled nodes. This widely-adopted approach implicitly assumes that vertex labels are independent after conditioning on their neighborhoods. We show that this strong assumption is far from true on many real-world graph datasets and severely limits predictive power on a number of regression tasks. Given that traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning methods operate in the opposite manner by explicitly modeling the correlation in predicted outcomes, this limitation may not be all that surprising. Here, we address this issue with a simple and interpretable framework that can improve any graph neural network architecture by modeling correlation structure in regression outcome residuals. Specifically, we model the joint distribution of outcome residuals on vertices with a parameterized multivariate Gaussian, where the parameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed labels. Our model achieves substantially boosts the performance of graph neural networks, and the learned parameters can also be interpreted as the strength of correlation among connected vertices. To allow us to scale to large networks, we design linear time algorithms for low-variance, unbiased model parameter estimates based on stochastic trace estimation. We also provide a simplified version of our method that makes stronger assumptions on correlation structure but is extremely easy to implement and provides great practical performance in several cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08274">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Molecule Attention Transformer</h3><h4>≈Åukasz Maziarka, Tomasz Danel, S≈Çawomir Mucha, Krzysztof Rataj, Jacek Tabor, Stanis≈Çaw Jastrzƒôbski</h4> Abstract: Designing a single neural network architecture that performs competitively across a range of molecule property prediction tasks remains largely an open challenge, and its solution may unlock a widespread use of deep learning in the drug discovery industry. To move towards this goal, we propose Molecule Attention Transformer (MAT). Our key innovation is to augment the attention mechanism in Transformer using inter-atomic distances and the molecular graph structure. Experiments show that MAT performs competitively on a diverse set of molecular prediction tasks. Most importantly, with a simple self-supervised pretraining, MAT requires tuning of only a few hyperparameter values to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks. Finally, we show that attention weights learned by MAT are interpretable from the chemical point of view. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08264">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	Knapsack Pruning with Inner Distillation</h3><h4>Yonathan Aflalo, Asaf Noy, Ming Lin, Itamar Friedman, Lihi Zelnik</h4> Abstract: Neural network pruning reduces the computational cost of an over-parameterized network to improve its efficiency. Popular methods vary from $\ell_1$-norm sparsification to Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that optimizes the final accuracy of the pruned network and distills knowledge from the over-parameterized parent network's inner layers. To enable this approach, we formulate the network pruning as a Knapsack Problem which optimizes the trade-off between the importance of neurons and their associated computational cost. Then we prune the network channels while maintaining the high-level structure of the network. The pruned network is fine-tuned under the supervision of the parent network using its inner network knowledge, a technique we refer to as the Inner Knowledge Distillation. Our method leads to state-of-the-art pruning results on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using ResNet backbones. To prune complex network structures such as convolutions with skip-links and depth-wise convolutions, we propose a block grouping approach to cope with these structures. Through this we produce compact architectures with the same FLOPs as EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV3 but with higher accuracy, by $1\%$ and $0.3\%$ respectively on ImageNet, and faster runtime on GPU. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08258">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	Learning Global Transparent Models from Local Contrastive Explanations</h3><h4>Tejaswini Pedapati, Avinash Balakrishnan, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Amit Dhurandhar</h4> Abstract: There is a rich and growing literature on producing local point wise contrastive/counterfactual explanations for complex models. These methods highlight what is important to justify the classification and/or produce a contrast point that alters the final classification. Other works try to build globally interpretable models like decision trees and rule lists directly by efficient model search using the data or by transferring information from a complex model using distillation-like methods. Although these interpretable global models can be useful, they may not be consistent with local explanations from a specific complex model of choice. In this work, we explore the question: Can we produce a transparent global model that is consistent with/derivable from local explanations? Based on a key insight we provide a novel method where every local contrastive/counterfactual explanation can be turned into a Boolean feature. These Boolean features are sparse conjunctions of binarized features. The dataset thus constructed is consistent with local explanations by design and one can train an interpretable model like a decision tree on it. We note that this approach strictly loses information due to reliance only on sparse local explanations, nonetheless, we demonstrate empirically that in many cases it can still be competitive with respect to the complex model's performance and also other methods that learn directly from the original dataset. Our approach also provides an avenue to benchmark local explanation methods in a quantitative manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08247">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Optimistic Policy Optimization with Bandit Feedback</h3><h4>Yonathan Efroni, Lior Shani, Aviv Rosenberg, Shie Mannor</h4> Abstract: Policy optimization methods are one of the most widely used classes of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, so far, such methods have been mostly analyzed from an optimization perspective, without addressing the problem of exploration, or by making strong assumptions on the interaction with the environment. In this paper we consider model-based RL in the tabular finite-horizon MDP setting with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. For this setting, we propose an optimistic trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2 A H^4 K})$ regret for stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{ S^2 A H^4 } K^{2/3} ) $ regret for adversarial rewards. Interestingly, this result matches previous bounds derived for the bandit feedback case, yet with known transitions. To the best of our knowledge, the two results are the first sub-linear regret bounds obtained for policy optimization algorithms with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08243">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 13	SYMOG: learning symmetric mixture of Gaussian modes for improved  fixed-point quantization</h3><h4>Lukas Enderich, Fabian Timm, Wolfram Burgard</h4> Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to outperform classical methods on several machine learning benchmarks. However, they have high computational complexity and require powerful processing units. Especially when deployed on embedded systems, model size and inference time must be significantly reduced. We propose SYMOG (symmetric mixture of Gaussian modes), which significantly decreases the complexity of DNNs through low-bit fixed-point quantization. SYMOG is a novel soft quantization method such that the learning task and the quantization are solved simultaneously. During training the weight distribution changes from an unimodal Gaussian distribution to a symmetric mixture of Gaussians, where each mean value belongs to a particular fixed-point mode. We evaluate our approach with different architectures (LeNet5, VGG7, VGG11, DenseNet) on common benchmark data sets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and we compare with state-of-the-art quantization approaches. We achieve excellent results and outperform 2-bit state-of-the-art performance with an error rate of only 5.71% on CIFAR-10 and 27.65% on CIFAR-100. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08204">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	Federated Learning in the Sky: Joint Power Allocation and Scheduling  with UAV Swarms</h3><h4>Tengchan Zeng, Omid Semiari, Mohammad Mozaffari, Mingzhe Chen, Walid Saad, Mehdi Bennis</h4> Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms must exploit machine learning (ML) in order to execute various tasks ranging from coordinated trajectory planning to cooperative target recognition. However, due to the lack of continuous connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35% compared with the baseline design. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08196">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Using Hindsight to Anchor Past Knowledge in Continual Learning</h3><h4>Arslan Chaudhry, Albert Gordo, Puneet K. Dokania, Philip Torr, David Lopez-Paz</h4> Abstract: In continual learning, the learner faces a stream of data whose distribution changes over time. Modern neural networks are known to suffer under this setting, as they quickly forget previously acquired knowledge. To address such catastrophic forgetting, many continual learning methods implement different types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer known as episodic memory. In this work, we complement experience replay with a new objective that we call anchoring, where the learner uses bilevel optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory of past tasks. Experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for continual learning demonstrate that our approach improves the standard experience replay in terms of both accuracy and forgetting metrics and for various sizes of episodic memories. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08165">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Gradient-Adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles for Comprehensive  Introspection of Convolutional Speech Recognition Models</h3><h4>Andreas Krug, Sebastian Stober</h4> Abstract: Deep Learning based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are very successful, but hard to interpret. To gain better understanding of how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) accomplish their tasks, introspection methods have been proposed. Adapting such techniques from computer vision to speech recognition is not straight-forward, because speech data is more complex and less interpretable than image data. In this work, we introduce Gradient-adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles (GradNAPs) as means to interpret features and representations in Deep Neural Networks. GradNAPs are characteristic responses of ANNs to particular groups of inputs, which incorporate the relevance of neurons for prediction. We show how to utilize GradNAPs to gain insight about how data is processed in ANNs. This includes different ways of visualizing features and clustering of GradNAPs to compare embeddings of different groups of inputs in any layer of a given network. We demonstrate our proposed techniques using a fully-convolutional ASR model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08125">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Randomized Smoothing of All Shapes and Sizes</h3><h4>Greg Yang, Tony Duan, Edward Hu, Hadi Salman, Ilya Razenshteyn, Jerry Li</h4> Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a recently proposed defense against adversarial attacks that has achieved state-of-the-art provable robustness against $\ell_2$ perturbations. Soon after, a number of works devised new randomized smoothing schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$; however, for each geometry, substantial effort was needed to derive new robustness guarantees. This begs the question: can we find a general theory for randomized smoothing? In this work we propose a novel framework for devising and analyzing randomized smoothing schemes, and validate its effectiveness in practice. Our theoretical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that for an appropriate notion of "optimal", the optimal smoothing distributions for any "nice" norm have level sets given by the *Wulff Crystal* of that norm. (2) We propose two novel and complementary methods for deriving provably robust radii for any smoothing distribution. Finally, (3) we show fundamental limits to current randomized smoothing techniques via the theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By combining (1) and (2), we significantly improve the state-of-the-art certified accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard datasets. On the other hand, using (3), we show that, without more information than label statistics under random input perturbations, randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial certified accuracy against perturbations of $\ell_\infty$-norm $\Omega(1/\sqrt d)$, when the input dimension $d$ is large. We provide code in github.com/tonyduan/rs4a. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08118">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 18	Hierarchical Quantized Autoencoders</h3><h4>Will Williams, Sam Ringer, Tom Ash, John Hughes, David MacLeod, Jamie Dougherty</h4> Abstract: Despite progress in training neural networks for lossy image compression, current approaches fail to maintain both perceptual quality and high-level features at very low bitrates. Encouraged by recent success in learning discrete representations with Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs), we motivate the use of a hierarchy of VQ-VAEs to attain high factors of compression. We show that the combination of quantization and hierarchical latent structure aids likelihood-based image compression. This leads us to introduce a more probabilistic framing of the VQ-VAE, of which previous work is a limiting case. Our hierarchy produces a Markovian series of latent variables that reconstruct high-quality images which retain semantically meaningful features. These latents can then be further used to generate realistic samples. We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of reconstructions and samples on the CelebA and MNIST datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08111">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	Neural Networks on Random Graphs</h3><h4>Romuald A. Janik, Aleksandra Nowak</h4> Abstract: We performed a massive evaluation of neural networks with architectures corresponding to random graphs of various types. Apart from the classical random graph families including random, scale-free and small world graphs, we introduced a novel and flexible algorithm for directly generating random directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and studied a class of graphs derived from functional resting state fMRI networks. A majority of the best performing networks were indeed in these new families. We also proposed a general procedure for turning a graph into a DAG necessary for a feed-forward neural network. We investigated various structural and numerical properties of the graphs in relation to neural network test accuracy. Since none of the classical numerical graph invariants by itself seems to allow to single out the best networks, we introduced new numerical characteristics that selected a set of quasi-1-dimensional graphs, which were the majority among the best performing networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08104">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Logarithmic Regret for Learning Linear Quadratic Regulators Efficiently</h3><h4>Asaf Cassel (1), Alon Cohen (2), Tomer Koren (1) ((1) School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, (2) Google Research, Tel Aviv)</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of learning in Linear Quadratic Control systems whose transition parameters are initially unknown. Recent results in this setting have demonstrated efficient learning algorithms with regret growing with the square root of the number of decision steps. We present new efficient algorithms that achieve, perhaps surprisingly, regret that scales only (poly)logarithmically with the number of steps in two scenarios: when only the state transition matrix $A$ is unknown, and when only the state-action transition matrix $B$ is unknown and the optimal policy satisfies a certain non-degeneracy condition. On the other hand, we give a lower bound that shows that when the latter condition is violated, square root regret is unavoidable. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08095">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Dissecting Neural ODEs</h3><h4>Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli, Jinkyoo Park, Atsushi Yamashita, Hajime Asama</h4> Abstract: Continuous deep learning architectures have recently re-emerged as variants of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). The infinite-depth approach offered by these models theoretically bridges the gap between deep learning and dynamical systems; however, deciphering their inner working is still an open challenge and most of their applications are currently limited to the inclusion as generic black-box modules. In this work, we "open the box" and offer a system-theoretic perspective, including state augmentation strategies and robustness, with the aim of clarifying the influence of several design choices on the underlying dynamics. We also introduce novel architectures: among them, a Galerkin-inspired depth-varying parameter model and neural ODEs with data-controlled vector fields. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08071">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	The Geometry of Sign Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Lukas Balles, Fabian Pedregosa, Nicolas Le Roux</h4> Abstract: Sign-based optimization methods have become popular in machine learning due to their favorable communication cost in distributed optimization and their surprisingly good performance in neural network training. Furthermore, they are closely connected to so-called adaptive gradient methods like Adam. Recent works on signSGD have used a non-standard "separable smoothness" assumption, whereas some older works study sign gradient descent as steepest descent with respect to the $\ell_\infty$-norm. In this work, we unify these existing results by showing a close connection between separable smoothness and $\ell_\infty$-smoothness and argue that the latter is the weaker and more natural assumption. We then proceed to study the smoothness constant with respect to the $\ell_\infty$-norm and thereby isolate geometric properties of the objective function which affect the performance of sign-based methods. In short, we find sign-based methods to be preferable over gradient descent if (i) the Hessian is to some degree concentrated on its diagonal, and (ii) its maximal eigenvalue is much larger than the average eigenvalue. Both properties are common in deep networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08056">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Progressive Identification of True Labels for Partial-Label Learning</h3><h4>Jiaqi Lv, Miao Xu, Lei Feng, Gang Niu, Xin Geng, Masashi Sugiyama</h4> Abstract: Partial-label learning is one of the important weakly supervised learning problems, where each training example is equipped with a set of candidate labels that contains the true label. Most existing methods elaborately designed learning objectives as constrained optimizations that must be solved in specific manners, making their computational complexity a bottleneck for scaling up to big data. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework of partial-label learning without implicit assumptions on the model or optimization algorithm. More specifically, we propose a general estimator of the classification risk, theoretically analyze the classifier-consistency, and establish an estimation error bound. We then explore a progressive identification method for approximately minimizing the proposed risk estimator, where the update of the model and identification of true labels are conducted in a seamless manner. The resulting algorithm is model-independent and loss-independent, and compatible with stochastic optimization. Thorough experiments demonstrate it sets the new state of the art. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08053">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Enlarging Discriminative Power by Adding an Extra Class in Unsupervised  Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Hai H. Tran, Sumyeong Ahn, Taeyoung Lee, Yung Yi</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation that aims at obtaining a prediction model for the target domain using labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. There exists an array of recent research based on the idea of extracting features that are not only invariant for both domains but also provide high discriminative power for the target domain. In this paper, we propose an idea of empowering the discriminativeness: Adding a new, artificial class and training the model on the data together with the GAN-generated samples of the new class. The trained model based on the new class samples is capable of extracting the features that are more discriminative by repositioning data of current classes in the target domain and therefore drawing the decision boundaries more effectively. Our idea is highly generic so that it is compatible with many existing methods such as DANN, VADA, and DIRT-T. We conduct various experiments for the standard data commonly used for the evaluation of unsupervised domain adaptations and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the SOTA performance for many scenarios. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08041">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning through Policy Transfer</h3><h4>Tianpei Yang, Jianye Hao, Zhaopeng Meng, Zongzhang Zhang, Weixun Wang, Yujing Hu, Yingfeng Cheng, Changjie Fan, Zhaodong Wang, Jiajie Peng</h4> Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) has shown great potential to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) by leveraging prior knowledge from past learned policies of relevant tasks. Existing transfer approaches either explicitly computes the similarity between tasks or select appropriate source policies to provide guided explorations for the target task. However, how to directly optimize the target policy by alternatively utilizing knowledge from appropriate source policies without explicitly measuring the similarity is currently missing. In this paper, we propose a novel Policy Transfer Framework (PTF) to accelerate RL by taking advantage of this idea. Our framework learns when and which source policy is the best to reuse for the target policy and when to terminate it by modeling multi-policy transfer as the option learning problem. PTF can be easily combined with existing deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it significantly accelerates the learning process and surpasses state-of-the-art policy transfer methods in terms of learning efficiency and final performance in both discrete and continuous action spaces. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08037">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	A Fixed point view: A Model-Based Clustering Framework</h3><h4>Jianhao Ding, Lansheng Han</h4> Abstract: With the inflation of the data, clustering analysis, as a branch of unsupervised learning, lacks unified understanding and application of its mathematical law. Based on the view of fixed point, this paper restates the model-based clustering and proposes a unified clustering framework. In order to find fixed points as cluster centers, the framework iteratively constructs the contraction map, which strongly reveals the convergence mechanism and interconnections among algorithms. By specifying a contraction map, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) can be mapped to the framework as an application. We hope the fixed point framework will help the design of future clustering algorithms. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08032">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Indirect Adversarial Attacks via Poisoning Neighbors for Graph  Convolutional Networks</h3><h4>Tsubasa Takahashi</h4> Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks, which learn aggregations over neighbor nodes, have achieved great performance in node classification tasks. However, recent studies reported that such graph convolutional node classifier can be deceived by adversarial perturbations on graphs. Abusing graph convolutions, a node's classification result can be influenced by poisoning its neighbors. Given an attributed graph and a node classifier, how can we evaluate robustness against such indirect adversarial attacks? Can we generate strong adversarial perturbations which are effective on not only one-hop neighbors, but more far from the target? In this paper, we demonstrate that the node classifier can be deceived with high-confidence by poisoning just a single node even two-hops or more far from the target. Towards achieving the attack, we propose a new approach which searches smaller perturbations on just a single node far from the target. In our experiments, our proposed method shows 99% attack success rate within two-hops from the target in two datasets. We also demonstrate that m-layer graph convolutional neural networks have chance to be deceived by our indirect attack within m-hop neighbors. The proposed attack can be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to develop graph convolutional neural networks with having adversary robustness. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08012">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Action-Manipulation Attacks Against Stochastic Bandits: Attacks and  Defense</h3><h4>Guanlin Liu, Lifeng lai</h4> Abstract: Due to the broad range of applications of stochastic multi-armed bandit model, understanding the effects of adversarial attacks and designing bandit algorithms robust to attacks are essential for the safe applications of this model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of attack named action-manipulation attack. In this attack, an adversary can change the action signal selected by the user. We show that without knowledge of mean rewards of arms, our proposed attack can manipulate Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, a widely used bandit algorithm, into pulling a target arm very frequently by spending only logarithmic cost. To defend against this class of attacks, we introduce a novel algorithm that is robust to action-manipulation attacks when an upper bound for the total attack cost is given. We prove that our algorithm has a pseudo-regret upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\max\{\log T,A\})$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds and $A$ is the upper bound of the total attack cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08000">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Best-item Learning in Random Utility Models with Subset Choices</h3><h4>Aadirupa Saha, Aditya Gopalan</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of PAC learning the most valuable item from a pool of $n$ items using sequential, adaptively chosen plays of subsets of $k$ items, when, upon playing a subset, the learner receives relative feedback sampled according to a general Random Utility Model (RUM) with independent noise perturbations to the latent item utilities. We identify a new property of such a RUM, termed the minimum advantage, that helps in characterizing the complexity of separating pairs of items based on their relative win/loss empirical counts, and can be bounded as a function of the noise distribution alone. We give a learning algorithm for general RUMs, based on pairwise relative counts of items and hierarchical elimination, along with a new PAC sample complexity guarantee of $O(\frac{n}{c^2\epsilon^2} \log \frac{k}{\delta})$ rounds to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal item with confidence $1-\delta$, when the worst case pairwise advantage in the RUM has sensitivity at least $c$ to the parameter gaps of items. Fundamental lower bounds on PAC sample complexity show that this is near-optimal in terms of its dependence on $n,k$ and $c$. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07994">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 31	Being Bayesian about Categorical Probability</h3><h4>Taejong Joo, Uijung Chung, Min-Gwan Seo</h4> Abstract: Neural networks utilize the softmax as a building block in classification tasks, which contains an overconfidence problem and lacks an uncertainty representation ability. As a Bayesian alternative to the softmax, we consider a random variable of a categorical probability over class labels. In this framework, the prior distribution explicitly models the presumed noise inherent in the observed label, which provides consistent gains in generalization performance in multiple challenging tasks. The proposed method inherits advantages of Bayesian approaches that achieve better uncertainty estimation and model calibration. Our method can be implemented as a plug-and-play loss function with negligible computational overhead compared to the softmax with the cross-entropy loss function. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07965">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	Inductive Representation Learning on Temporal Graphs</h3><h4>Da Xu, Chuanwei Ruan, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan</h4> Abstract: Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks. The evolving nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task, and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph embedding approaches. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07962">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Curriculum in Gradient-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Bhairav Mehta, Tristan Deleu, Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Chris J. Pal, Liam Paull</h4> Abstract: Gradient-based meta-learners such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) have shown strong few-shot performance in supervised and reinforcement learning settings. However, specifically in the case of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL), we can show that gradient-based meta-learners are sensitive to task distributions. With the wrong curriculum, agents suffer the effects of meta-overfitting, shallow adaptation, and adaptation instability. In this work, we begin by highlighting intriguing failure cases of gradient-based meta-RL and show that task distributions can wildly affect algorithmic outputs, stability, and performance. To address this problem, we leverage insights from recent literature on domain randomization and propose meta Active Domain Randomization (meta-ADR), which learns a curriculum of tasks for gradient-based meta-RL in a similar as ADR does for sim2real transfer. We show that this approach induces more stable policies on a variety of simulated locomotion and navigation tasks. We assess in- and out-of-distribution generalization and find that the learned task distributions, even in an unstructured task space, greatly improve the adaptation performance of MAML. Finally, we motivate the need for better benchmarking in meta-RL that prioritizes \textit{generalization} over single-task adaption performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07956">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Personalized Federated Learning: A Meta-Learning Approach</h3><h4>Alireza Fallah, Aryan Mokhtari, Asuman Ozdaglar</h4> Abstract: The goal of federated learning is to design algorithms in which several agents communicate with a central node, in a privacy-protecting manner, to minimize the average of their loss functions. In this approach, each node not only shares the required computational budget but also has access to a larger data set, which improves the quality of the resulting model. However, this method only develops a common output for all the agents, and therefore, does not adapt the model to each user data. This is an important missing feature especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for various agents. In this paper, we study a personalized variant of the federated learning in which our goal is to find a shared initial model in a distributed manner that can be slightly updated by either a current or a new user by performing one or a few steps of gradient descent with respect to its own loss function. This approach keeps all the benefits of the federated learning architecture while leading to a more personalized model for each user. We show this problem can be studied within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework. Inspired by this connection, we propose a personalized variant of the well-known Federated Averaging algorithm and evaluate its performance in terms of gradient norm for non-convex loss functions. Further, we characterize how this performance is affected by the closeness of underlying distributions of user data, measured in terms of distribution distances such as Total Variation and 1-Wasserstein metric. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07948">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Source Separation with Deep Generative Priors</h3><h4>Vivek Jayaram, John Thickstun</h4> Abstract: Despite substantial progress in signal source separation, results for richly structured data continue to contain perceptible artifacts. In contrast, recent deep generative models can produce authentic samples in a variety of domains that are indistinguishable from samples of the data distribution. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to source separation that uses generative models as priors over the components of a mixture of sources, and Langevin dynamics to sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This decouples the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us to directly use cutting-edge generative models as priors. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance for MNIST digit separation. We introduce new methodology for evaluating separation quality on richer datasets, providing quantitative evaluation of separation results on CIFAR-10. We also provide qualitative results on LSUN. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07942">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	Improving Generalization by Controlling Label-Noise Information in  Neural Network Weights</h3><h4>Hrayr Harutyunyan, Kyle Reing, Greg Ver Steeg, Aram Galstyan</h4> Abstract: In the presence of noisy or incorrect labels, neural networks have the undesirable tendency to memorize information about the noise. Standard regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay or data augmentation sometimes help, but do not prevent this behavior. If one considers neural network weights as random variables that depend on the data and stochasticity of training, the amount of memorized information can be quantified with the Shannon mutual information between weights and the vector of all training labels given inputs, $I(w : \mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x})$. We show that for any training algorithm, low values of this term correspond to reduction in memorization of label-noise and better generalization bounds. To obtain these low values, we propose training algorithms that employ an auxiliary network that predicts gradients in the final layers of a classifier without accessing labels. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 corrupted with various noise models, and on a large-scale dataset Clothing1M that has noisy labels. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07933">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 38	Block Switching: A Stochastic Approach for Deep Learning Security</h3><h4>Xiao Wang, Siyue Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xue Lin, Peter Chin</h4> Abstract: Recent study of adversarial attacks has revealed the vulnerability of modern deep learning models. That is, subtly crafted perturbations of the input can make a trained network with high accuracy produce arbitrary incorrect predictions, while maintain imperceptible to human vision system. In this paper, we introduce Block Switching (BS), a defense strategy against adversarial attacks based on stochasticity. BS replaces a block of model layers with multiple parallel channels, and the active channel is randomly assigned in the run time hence unpredictable to the adversary. We show empirically that BS leads to a more dispersed input gradient distribution and superior defense effectiveness compared with other stochastic defenses such as stochastic activation pruning (SAP). Compared to other defenses, BS is also characterized by the following features: (i) BS causes less test accuracy drop; (ii) BS is attack-independent and (iii) BS is compatible with other defenses and can be used jointly with others. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07920">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Information Condensing Active Learning</h3><h4>Siddhartha Jain, Ge Liu, David Gifford</h4> Abstract: We introduce Information Condensing Active Learning (ICAL), a batch mode model agnostic Active Learning (AL) method targeted at Deep Bayesian Active Learning that focuses on acquiring labels for points which have as much information as possible about the still unacquired points. ICAL uses the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the strength of the dependency between a candidate batch of points and the unlabeled set. We develop key optimizations that allow us to scale our method to large unlabeled sets. We show significant improvements in terms of model accuracy and negative log likelihood (NLL) on several image datasets compared to state of the art batch mode AL methods for deep learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07916">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Generating Automatic Curricula via Self-Supervised Active Domain  Randomization</h3><h4>Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Bhairav Mehta, Florian Golemo, Liam Paull</h4> Abstract: Goal-directed Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally considers an agent interacting with an environment, prescribing a real-valued reward to an agent proportional to the completion of some goal. Goal-directed RL has seen large gains in sample efficiency, due to the ease of reusing or generating new experience by proposing goals. In this work, we build on the framework of self-play, allowing an agent to interact with itself in order to make progress on some unknown task. We use Active Domain Randomization and self-play to create a novel, coupled environment-goal curriculum, where agents learn through progressively more difficult tasks and environment variations. Our method, Self-Supervised Active Domain Randomization (SS-ADR), generates a growing curriculum, encouraging the agent to try tasks that are just outside of its current capabilities, while building a domain-randomization curriculum that enables state-of-the-art results on various sim2real transfer tasks. Our results show that a curriculum of co-evolving the environment difficulty along with the difficulty of goals set in each environment provides practical benefits in the goal-directed tasks tested. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07911">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	CAUSE: Learning Granger Causality from Event Sequences using Attribution  Methods</h3><h4>Wei Zhang, Thomas Kobber Panum, Somesh Jha, Prasad Chalasani, David Page</h4> Abstract: We study the problem of learning Granger causality between event types from asynchronous, interdependent, multi-type event sequences. Existing work suffers from either limited model flexibility or poor model explainability and thus fails to uncover Granger causality across a wide variety of event sequences with diverse event interdependency. To address these weaknesses, we propose CAUSE (Causality from AttribUtions on Sequence of Events), a novel framework for the studied task. The key idea of CAUSE is to first implicitly capture the underlying event interdependency by fitting a neural point process, and then extract from the process a Granger causality statistic using an axiomatic attribution method. Across multiple datasets riddled with diverse event interdependency, we demonstrate that CAUSE achieves superior performance on correctly inferring the inter-type Granger causality over a range of state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07906">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Empirical Policy Evaluation with Supergraphs</h3><h4>Daniel Vial, Vijay Subramanian</h4> Abstract: We devise and analyze algorithms for the empirical policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning. Our algorithms explore backward from high-cost states to find high-value ones, in contrast to forward approaches that work forward from all states. While several papers have demonstrated the utility of backward exploration empirically, we conduct rigorous analyses which show that our algorithms can reduce average-case sample complexity from $O(S \log S)$ to as low as $O(\log S)$. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07905">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	Deep Transform and Metric Learning Network: Wedding Deep Dictionary  Learning and Neural Networks</h3><h4>Wen Tang, Emilie Chouzenoux, Jean-Christophe Pesquet, Hamid Krim</h4> Abstract: On account of its many successes in inference tasks and denoising applications, Dictionary Learning (DL) and its related sparse optimization problems have garnered a lot of research interest. While most solutions have focused on single layer dictionaries, the improved recently proposed Deep DL (DDL) methods have also fallen short on a number of issues. We propose herein, a novel DDL approach where each DL layer can be formulated as a combination of one linear layer and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is shown to flexibly account for the layer-associated and learned metric. Our proposed work unveils new insights into Neural Networks and DDL and provides a new, efficient and competitive approach to jointly learn a deep transform and a metric for inference applications. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method can not only outperform existing DDL but also state-of-the-art generic CNNs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07898">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Towards Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversary with Zeroth-Order Natural  Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Pu Zhao, Pin-Yu Chen, Siyue Wang, Xue Lin</h4> Abstract: Despite the great achievements of the modern deep neural networks (DNNs), the vulnerability/robustness of state-of-the-art DNNs raises security concerns in many application domains requiring high reliability. Various adversarial attacks are proposed to sabotage the learning performance of DNN models. Among those, the black-box adversarial attack methods have received special attentions owing to their practicality and simplicity. Black-box attacks usually prefer less queries in order to maintain stealthy and low costs. However, most of the current black-box attack methods adopt the first-order gradient descent method, which may come with certain deficiencies such as relatively slow convergence and high sensitivity to hyper-parameter settings. In this paper, we propose a zeroth-order natural gradient descent (ZO-NGD) method to design the adversarial attacks, which incorporates the zeroth-order gradient estimation technique catering to the black-box attack scenario and the second-order natural gradient descent to achieve higher query efficiency. The empirical evaluations on image classification datasets demonstrate that ZO-NGD can obtain significantly lower model query complexities compared with state-of-the-art attack methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07891">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Global Convergence of Deep Networks with One Wide Layer Followed by  Pyramidal Topology</h3><h4>Quynh Nguyen, Marco Mondelli</h4> Abstract: A recent line of research has provided convergence guarantees for gradient descent algorithms in the excessive over-parameterization regime where the widths of all the hidden layers are required to be polynomially large in the number of training samples. However, the widths of practical deep networks are often only large in the first layer(s) and then start to decrease towards the output layer. This raises an interesting open question whether similar results also hold under this empirically relevant setting. Existing theoretical insights suggest that the loss surface of this class of networks is well-behaved, but these results usually do not provide direct algorithmic guarantees for optimization. In this paper, we close the gap by showing that one wide layer followed by pyramidal deep network topology suffices for gradient descent to find a global minimum with a geometric rate. Our proof is based on a weak form of Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality which holds for deep pyramidal networks in the manifold of full-rank weight matrices. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07867">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	Learning Similarity Metrics for Numerical Simulations</h3><h4>Georg Kohl, Kiwon Um, Nils Thuerey</h4> Abstract: We propose a neural network-based approach that computes a stable and generalizing metric (LSiM), to compare field data from a variety of numerical simulation sources. Our method employs a Siamese network architecture that is motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric. We leverage a controllable data generation setup with partial differential equation (PDE) solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation in a controlled environment. A central component of our learned metric is a specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing simple metrics for vector spaces and other learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze benefits for generalization and the impact of an adjustable training data difficulty. The robustness of LSiM is demonstrated via an evaluation on three real-world data sets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07863">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Is Local SGD Better than Minibatch SGD?</h3><h4>Blake Woodworth, Kumar Kshitij Patel, Sebastian U. Stich, Zhen Dai, Brian Bullins, H. Brendan McMahan, Ohad Shamir, Nathan Srebro</h4> Abstract: We study local SGD (also known as parallel SGD and federated averaging), a natural and frequently used stochastic distributed optimization method. Its theoretical foundations are currently lacking and we highlight how all existing error guarantees in the convex setting are dominated by a simple baseline, minibatch SGD. (1) For quadratic objectives we prove that local SGD strictly dominates minibatch SGD and that accelerated local SGD is minimax optimal for quadratics; (2) For general convex objectives we provide the first guarantee that at least sometimes improves over minibatch SGD; (3) We show that indeed local SGD does not dominate minibatch SGD by presenting a lower bound on the performance of local SGD that is worse than the minibatch SGD guarantee. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07839">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	Multi-Step Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning: Convergence and Improved  Algorithms</h3><h4>Kaiyi Ji, Junjie Yang, Yingbin Liang</h4> Abstract: As a popular meta-learning approach, the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the convergence of the general multi-step MAML still remains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical framework, under which we characterize the convergence rate and the computational complexity of multi-step MAML. Our results indicate that although the estimation bias and variance of the stochastic meta gradient involve exponential factors of $N$ (the number of the inner-stage gradient updates), MAML still attains the convergence with complexity increasing only linearly with $N$ with a properly chosen inner stepsize. We then take a further step to develop a more efficient Hessian-free MAML. We first show that the existing zeroth-order Hessian estimator contains a constant-level estimation error so that the MAML algorithm can perform unstably. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hessian estimator via a gradient-based Gaussian smoothing method, and show that it achieves a much smaller estimation bias and variance, and the resulting algorithm achieves the same performance guarantee as the original MAML under mild conditions. Our experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Hessian estimator. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07836">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 49	Deep regularization and direct training of the inner layers of Neural  Networks with Kernel Flows</h3><h4>Gene Ryan Yoo, Houman Owhadi</h4> Abstract: We introduce a new regularization method for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on Kernel Flows (KFs). KFs were introduced as a method for kernel selection in regression/kriging based on the minimization of the loss of accuracy incurred by halving the number of interpolation points in random batches of the dataset. Writing $f_\theta(x) = \big(f^{(n)}_{\theta_n}\circ f^{(n-1)}_{\theta_{n-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ for the functional representation of compositional structure of the ANN, the inner layers outputs $h^{(i)}(x) = \big(f^{(i)}_{\theta_i}\circ f^{(i-1)}_{\theta_{i-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ define a hierarchy of feature maps and kernels $k^{(i)}(x,x')=\exp(- \gamma_i \|h^{(i)}(x)-h^{(i)}(x')\|_2^2)$. When combined with a batch of the dataset these kernels produce KF losses $e_2^{(i)}$ (the $L^2$ regression error incurred by using a random half of the batch to predict the other half) depending on parameters of inner layers $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_i$ (and $\gamma_i$). The proposed method simply consists in aggregating a subset of these KF losses with a classical output loss. We test the proposed method on CNNs and WRNs without alteration of structure nor output classifier and report reduced test errors, decreased generalization gaps, and increased robustness to distribution shift without significant increase in computational complexity. We suspect that these results might be explained by the fact that while conventional training only employs a linear functional (a generalized moment) of the empirical distribution defined by the dataset and can be prone to trapping in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime (under over-parameterizations), the proposed loss function (defined as a nonlinear functional of the empirical distribution) effectively trains the underlying kernel defined by the CNN beyond regressing the data with that kernel. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08335">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 50	Towards Intelligent Pick and Place Assembly of Individualized Products  Using Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Caterina Neef, Dario Luipers, Jan Bollenbacher, Christian Gebel, Anja Richert</h4> Abstract: Individualized manufacturing is becoming an important approach as a means to fulfill increasingly diverse and specific consumer requirements and expectations. While there are various solutions to the implementation of the manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing, the subsequent automated assembly remains a challenging task. As an approach to this problem, we aim to teach a collaborative robot to successfully perform pick and place tasks by implementing reinforcement learning. For the assembly of an individualized product in a constantly changing manufacturing environment, the simulated geometric and dynamic parameters will be varied. Using reinforcement learning algorithms capable of meta-learning, the tasks will first be trained in simulation. They will then be performed in a real-world environment where new factors are introduced that were not simulated in training to confirm the robustness of the algorithms. The robot will gain its input data from tactile sensors, area scan cameras, and 3D cameras used to generate heightmaps of the environment and the objects. The selection of machine learning algorithms and hardware components as well as further research questions to realize the outlined production scenario are the results of the presented work. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08333">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 51	Fawkes: Protecting Personal Privacy against Unauthorized Deep Learning  Models</h3><h4>Shawn Shan, Emily Wenger, Jiayun Zhang, Huiying Li, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y. Zhao</h4> Abstract: Today's proliferation of powerful facial recognition models poses a real threat to personal privacy. As Clearview.ai demonstrated, anyone can canvas the Internet for data, and train highly accurate facial recognition models of us without our knowledge. We need tools to protect ourselves from unauthorized facial recognition systems and their numerous potential misuses. Unfortunately, work in related areas are limited in practicality and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Fawkes, a system that allow individuals to inoculate themselves against unauthorized facial recognition models. Fawkes achieves this by helping users adding imperceptible pixel-level changes (we call them "cloaks") to their own photos before publishing them online. When collected by a third-party "tracker" and used to train facial recognition models, these "cloaked" images produce functional models that consistently misidentify the user. We experimentally prove that Fawkes provides 95+% protection against user recognition regardless of how trackers train their models. Even when clean, uncloaked images are "leaked" to the tracker and used for training, Fawkes can still maintain a 80+% protection success rate. In fact, we perform real experiments against today's state-of-the-art facial recognition services and achieve 100% success. Finally, we show that Fawkes is robust against a variety of countermeasures that try to detect or disrupt cloaks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08327">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 52	Balancing Efficiency and Flexibility for DNN Acceleration via Temporal  GPU-Systolic Array Integration</h3><h4>Cong Guo, Yangjie Zhou, Jingwen Leng, Yuhao Zhu, Zidong Du, Quan Chen, Chao Li, Minyi Guo, Bin Yao</h4> Abstract: The research interest in specialized hardware accelerators for deep neural networks (DNN) spiked recently owing to their superior performance and efficiency. However, today's DNN accelerators primarily focus on accelerating specific "kernels" such as convolution and matrix multiplication, which are vital but only part of an end-to-end DNN-enabled application. Meaningful speedups over the entire application often require supporting computations that are, while massively parallel, ill-suited to DNN accelerators. Integrating a general-purpose processor such as a CPU or a GPU incurs significant data movement overhead and leads to resource under-utilization on the DNN accelerators. We propose Simultaneous Multi-mode Architecture (SMA), a novel architecture design and execution model that offers general-purpose programmability on DNN accelerators in order to accelerate end-to-end applications. The key to SMA is the temporal integration of the systolic execution model with the GPU-like SIMD execution model. The SMA exploits the common components shared between the systolic-array accelerator and the GPU, and provides lightweight reconfiguration capability to switch between the two modes in-situ. The SMA achieves up to 63% performance improvement while consuming 23% less energy than the baseline Volta architecture with TensorCore. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08326">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 54	Non-Aligned Distribution Distance using Metric Measure Embedding and  Optimal Transport</h3><h4>Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Maxime B√©rar, Gilles Gasso, Alain Rakotomamonjy</h4> Abstract: We propose a novel approach for comparing distributions whose supports do not necessarily lie on the same metric space. Unlike Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance that compares pairwise distance of elements from each distribution, we consider a method that embeds the metric measure spaces in a common Euclidean space and computes an optimal transport (OT) on the embedded distributions. This leads to what we call a sub-embedding robust Wasserstein(SERW). Under some conditions, SERW is a distance that considers an OT distance of the (low-distorted) embedded distributions using a common metric. In addition to this novel proposal that generalizes several recent OT works, our contributions stand on several theoretical analyses: i) we characterize the embedding spaces to define SERW distance for distribution alignment; ii) we prove that SERW mimics almost the same properties of GW distance, and we give a cost relation between GW and SERW. The paper also provides some numerical experiments illustrating how SERW behaves on matching problems in real-world. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08314">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 55	NNoculation: Broad Spectrum and Targeted Treatment of Backdoored DNNs</h3><h4>Akshaj Kumar Veldanda, Kang Liu, Benjamin Tan, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Ramesh Karri, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Siddharth Garg</h4> Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage defense (NNoculation) against backdoored neural networks (BadNets) that, unlike existing defenses, makes minimal assumptions on the shape, size and location of backdoor triggers and BadNet's functioning. In the pre-deployment stage, NNoculation retrains the network using "broad-spectrum" random perturbations of inputs drawn from a clean validation set to partially reduce the adversarial impact of a backdoor. In the post-deployment stage, NNoculation detects and quarantines backdoored test inputs by recording disagreements between the original and pre-deployment patched networks. A CycleGAN is then trained to learn transformations between clean validation inputs and quarantined inputs; i.e., it learns to add triggers to clean validation images. This transformed set of backdoored validation images along with their correct labels is used to further retrain the BadNet, yielding our final defense. NNoculation outperforms state-of-the-art defenses NeuralCleanse and Artificial Brain Simulation (ABS) that we show are ineffective when their restrictive assumptions are circumvented by the attacker. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08313">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 56	Multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network for image  denoising</h3><h4>Shuo-Fei Wang, Wen-Kai Yu, Ya-Xin Li</h4> Abstract: Networks with large receptive field (RF) have shown advanced fitting ability in recent years. In this work, we utilize the short-term residual learning method to improve the performance and robustness of networks for image denoising tasks. Here, we choose a multi-wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN), one of the state-of-art networks with large RF, as the backbone, and insert residual dense blocks (RDBs) in its each layer. We call this scheme multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network (MWRDCNN). Compared with other RDB-based networks, it can extract more features of the object from adjacent layers, preserve the large RF, and boost the computing efficiency. Meanwhile, this approach also provides a possibility of absorbing advantages of multiple architectures in a single network without conflicts. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in extensive experiments with a comparison with existing techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08301">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 57	MLModelScope: A Distributed Platform for Model Evaluation and  Benchmarking at Scale</h3><h4>Abdul Dakkak, Cheng Li, Jinjun Xiong, Wen-mei Hwu</h4> Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) innovations are being introduced at such a rapid pace that researchers are hard-pressed to analyze and study them. The complicated procedures for evaluating innovations, along with the lack of standard and efficient ways of specifying and provisioning ML/DL evaluation, is a major "pain point" for the community. This paper proposes MLModelScope, an open-source, framework/hardware agnostic, extensible and customizable design that enables repeatable, fair, and scalable model evaluation and benchmarking. We implement the distributed design with support for all major frameworks and hardware, and equip it with web, command-line, and library interfaces. To demonstrate MLModelScope's capabilities we perform parallel evaluation and show how subtle changes to model evaluation pipeline affects the accuracy and HW/SW stack choices affect performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08295">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 58	When Radiology Report Generation Meets Knowledge Graph</h3><h4>Yixiao Zhang, Xiaosong Wang, Ziyue Xu, Qihang Yu, Alan Yuille, Daguang Xu</h4> Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation has been an attracting research problem towards computer-aided diagnosis to alleviate the workload of doctors in recent years. Deep learning techniques for natural image captioning are successfully adapted to generating radiology reports. However, radiology image reporting is different from the natural image captioning task in two aspects: 1) the accuracy of positive disease keyword mentions is critical in radiology image reporting in comparison to the equivalent importance of every single word in a natural image caption; 2) the evaluation of reporting quality should focus more on matching the disease keywords and their associated attributes instead of counting the occurrence of N-gram. Based on these concerns, we propose to utilize a pre-constructed graph embedding module (modeled with a graph convolutional neural network) on multiple disease findings to assist the generation of reports in this work. The incorporation of knowledge graph allows for dedicated feature learning for each disease finding and the relationship modeling between them. In addition, we proposed a new evaluation metric for radiology image reporting with the assistance of the same composed graph. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the methods integrated with the proposed graph embedding module on a publicly accessible dataset (IU-RR) of chest radiographs compared with previous approaches using both the conventional evaluation metrics commonly adopted for image captioning and our proposed ones. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08277">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 59	Partial Gromov-Wasserstein with Applications on Positive-Unlabeled  Learning</h3><h4>Laetitia Chapel, Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Gilles Gasso</h4> Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) framework allows defining similarity between probability distributions and provides metrics such as the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancies. Classical OT problem seeks a transportation map that preserves the total mass, requiring the mass of the source and target distributions to be the same. This may be too restrictive in certain applications such as color or shape matching, since the distributions may have arbitrary masses or that only a fraction of the total mass has to be transported. Several algorithms have been devised for computing unbalanced Wasserstein metrics but when it comes with the Gromov-Wasserstein problem, no partial formulation is available yet. This precludes from working with distributions that do not lie in the same metric space or when invariance to rotation or translation is needed. In this paper, we address the partial Gromov-Wasserstein problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. We showcase the new formulation in a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of optimal transport in this context and we first highlight that partial Wasserstein-based metrics prove effective in usual PU learning settings. We then demonstrate that partial Gromov-Wasserstein metrics is efficient in scenario where point clouds come from different domains or have different features. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08276">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 60	Multilogue-Net: A Context Aware RNN for Multi-modal Emotion Detection  and Sentiment Analysis in Conversation</h3><h4>Aman Shenoy, Ashish Sardana</h4> Abstract: Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection in conversation is key in a number of real-world applications, with different applications leveraging different kinds of data to be able to achieve reasonably accurate predictions. Multimodal Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis can be particularly useful as applications will be able to use specific subsets of the available modalities, as per their available data, to be able to produce relevant predictions. Current systems dealing with Multimodal functionality fail to leverage and capture the context of the conversation through all modalities, the current speaker and listener(s) in the conversation, and the relevance and relationship between the available modalities through an adequate fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network architecture that attempts to take into account all the mentioned drawbacks, and keeps track of the context of the conversation, interlocutor states, and the emotions conveyed by the speakers in the conversation. Our proposed model out performs the state of the art on two benchmark datasets on a variety of accuracy and regression metrics. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08267">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 61	Learning Bounds for Moment-Based Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Werner Zellinger, Bernhard A Moser, Susanne Saminger-Platz</h4> Abstract: Domain adaptation algorithms are designed to minimize the misclassification risk of a discriminative model for a target domain with little training data by adapting a model from a source domain with a large amount of training data. Standard approaches measure the adaptation discrepancy based on distance measures between the empirical probability distributions in the source and target domain. In this setting, we address the problem of deriving learning bounds under practice-oriented general conditions on the underlying probability distributions. As a result, we obtain learning bounds for domain adaptation based on finitely many moments and smoothness conditions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08260">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 62	Distance-Based Regularisation of Deep Networks for Fine-Tuning</h3><h4>Henry Gouk, Timothy M. Hospedales, Massimiliano Pontil</h4> Abstract: We investigate approaches to regularisation during fine-tuning of deep neural networks. First we provide a neural network generalisation bound based on Rademacher complexity that uses the distance the weights have moved from their initial values. This bound has no direct dependence on the number of weights and compares favourably to other bounds when applied to convolutional networks. Our bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with a good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify the weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this, we develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the hypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights, thus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional transfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well, corroborating our theoretical results. It outperforms both state of the art fine-tuning competitors, and penalty-based alternatives that we show do not directly constrain the radius of the search space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08253">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 63	Workshop Report: Detection and Classification in Marine Bioacoustics  with Deep Learning</h3><h4>Fabio Frazao, Bruno Padovese, Oliver S. Kirsebom</h4> Abstract: On 21-22 November 2019, about 30 researchers gathered in Victoria, BC, Canada, for the workshop "Detection and Classification in Marine Bioacoustics with Deep Learning" organized by MERIDIAN and hosted by Ocean Networks Canada. The workshop was attended by marine biologists, data scientists, and computer scientists coming from both Canadian coasts and the US and representing a wide spectrum of research organizations including universities, government (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), industry (JASCO Applied Sciences, Google, Axiom Data Science), and non-for-profits (Orcasound, OrcaLab). Consisting of a mix of oral presentations, open discussion sessions, and hands-on tutorials, the workshop program offered a rare opportunity for specialists from distinctly different domains to engage in conversation about deep learning and its promising potential for the development of detection and classification algorithms in underwater acoustics. In this workshop report, we summarize key points from the presentations and discussion sessions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08249">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 64	A Unified Convergence Analysis for Shuffling-Type Gradient Methods</h3><h4>Lam M. Nguyen, Quoc Tran-Dinh, Dzung T. Phan, Phuong Ha Nguyen, Marten van Dijk</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for a class of shuffling-type gradient methods for solving a well-known finite-sum minimization problem commonly used in machine learning. This algorithm covers various variants such as randomized reshuffling, single shuffling, and cyclic/incremental gradient schemes. We consider two different settings: strongly convex and non-convex problems. Our main contribution consists of new non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates for a general class of shuffling-type gradient methods to solve both non-convex and strongly convex problems. While our rate in the non-convex problem is new (i.e. not known yet under standard assumptions), the rate on the strongly convex case matches (up to a constant) the best-known results. However, unlike existing works in this direction, we only use standard assumptions such as smoothness and strong convexity. Finally, we empirically illustrate the effect of learning rates via a non-convex logistic regression and neural network examples. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08246">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 65	Quantum statistical query learning</h3><h4>Srinivasan Arunachalam, Alex B. Grilo, Henry Yuen</h4> Abstract: We propose a learning model called the quantum statistical learning QSQ model, which extends the SQ learning model introduced by Kearns to the quantum setting. Our model can be also seen as a restriction of the quantum PAC learning model: here, the learner does not have direct access to quantum examples, but can only obtain estimates of measurement statistics on them. Theoretically, this model provides a simple yet expressive setting to explore the power of quantum examples in machine learning. From a practical perspective, since simpler operations are required, learning algorithms in the QSQ model are more feasible for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We prove a number of results about the QSQ learning model. We first show that parity functions, (log n)-juntas and polynomial-sized DNF formulas are efficiently learnable in the QSQ model, in contrast to the classical setting where these problems are provably hard. This implies that many of the advantages of quantum PAC learning can be realized even in the more restricted quantum SQ learning model. It is well-known that weak statistical query dimension, denoted by WSQDIM(C), characterizes the complexity of learning a concept class C in the classical SQ model. We show that log(WSQDIM(C)) is a lower bound on the complexity of QSQ learning, and furthermore it is tight for certain concept classes C. Additionally, we show that this quantity provides strong lower bounds for the small-bias quantum communication model under product distributions. Finally, we introduce the notion of private quantum PAC learning, in which a quantum PAC learner is required to be differentially private. We show that learnability in the QSQ model implies learnability in the quantum private PAC model. Additionally, we show that in the private PAC learning setting, the classical and quantum sample complexities are equal, up to constant factors. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08240">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 66	Physics-informed Neural Networks for Solving Nonlinear Diffusivity and  Biot's equations</h3><h4>Teeratorn Kadeethum, Thomas M Jorgensen, Hamidreza M Nick</h4> Abstract: This paper presents the potential of applying physics-informed neural networks for solving nonlinear multiphysics problems, which are essential to many fields such as biomedical engineering, earthquake prediction, and underground energy harvesting. Specifically, we investigate how to extend the methodology of physics-informed neural networks to solve both the forward and inverse problems in relation to the nonlinear diffusivity and Biot's equations. We explore the accuracy of the physics-informed neural networks with different training example sizes and choices of hyperparameters. The impacts of the stochastic variations between various training realizations are also investigated. In the inverse case, we also study the effects of noisy measurements. Furthermore, we address the challenge of selecting the hyperparameters of the inverse model and illustrate how this challenge is linked to the hyperparameters selection performed for the forward one. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08235">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 67	Learning Fair Scoring Functions: Fairness Definitions, Algorithms and  Generalization Bounds for Bipartite Ranking</h3><h4>Robin Vogel, Aur√©lien Bellet, St√©phan Cl√©men√ßon</h4> Abstract: Many applications of artificial intelligence, ranging from credit lending to the design of medical diagnosis support tools through recidivism prediction, involve scoring individuals using a learned function of their attributes. These predictive risk scores are used to rank a set of people, and/or take individual decisions about them based on whether the score exceeds a certain threshold that may depend on the context in which the decision is taken. The level of delegation granted to such systems will heavily depend on how questions of fairness can be answered. While this concern has received a lot of attention in the classification setup, the design of relevant fairness constraints for the problem of learning scoring functions has not been much investigated. In this paper, we propose a flexible approach to group fairness for the scoring problem with binary labeled data, a standard learning task referred to as bipartite ranking. We argue that the functional nature of the ROC curve, the gold standard measuring ranking performance in this context, leads to several possible ways of formulating fairness constraints. We introduce general classes of fairness conditions in bipartite ranking and establish generalization bounds for scoring rules learned under such constraints. Beyond the theoretical formulation and results, we design practical learning algorithms and illustrate our approach with numerical experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08159">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 68	Variable-Bitrate Neural Compression via Bayesian Arithmetic Coding</h3><h4>Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler, Stephan Mandt</h4> Abstract: Deep Bayesian latent variable models have enabled new approaches to both model and data compression. Here, we propose a new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing. The approach thus separates model design and training from the compression task. Our algorithm generalizes arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty. A consequence of the "plug and play" nature of our approach is that various rate-distortion trade-offs can be achieved with a single trained model, eliminating the need to train multiple models for different bit rates. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates using only a single machine learning model. Further experiments on Bayesian neural word embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08158">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 69	Bayesian Experimental Design for Implicit Models by Mutual Information  Neural Estimation</h3><h4>Steven Kleinegesse, Michael U. Gutmann</h4> Abstract: Implicit stochastic models, where the data-generation distribution is intractable but sampling is possible, are ubiquitous in the natural sciences. The models typically have free parameters that need to be inferred from data collected in scientific experiments. A fundamental question is how to design the experiments so that the collected data are most useful. The field of Bayesian experimental design advocates that, ideally, we should choose designs that maximise the mutual information (MI) between the data and the parameters. For implicit models, however, this approach is severely hampered by the high computational cost of computing posteriors and maximising MI, in particular when we have more than a handful of design variables to optimise. In this paper, we propose a new approach to Bayesian experimental design for implicit models that leverages recent advances in neural MI estimation to deal with these issues. We show that training a neural network to maximise a lower bound on MI allows us to jointly determine the optimal design and the posterior. Simulation studies illustrate that this gracefully extends Bayesian experimental design for implicit models to higher design dimensions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08129">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 70	Rnn-transducer with language bias for end-to-end Mandarin-English  code-switching speech recognition</h3><h4>Shuai Zhang, Jiangyan Yi, Zhengkun Tian, Jianhua Tao, Ye Bai</h4> Abstract: Recently, language identity information has been utilized to improve the performance of end-to-end code-switching (CS) speech recognition. However, previous works use an additional language identification (LID) model as an auxiliary module, which causes the system complex. In this work, we propose an improved recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model with language bias to alleviate the problem. We use the language identities to bias the model to predict the CS points. This promotes the model to learn the language identity information directly from transcription, and no additional LID model is needed. We evaluate the approach on a Mandarin-English CS corpus SEAME. Compared to our RNN-T baseline, the proposed method can achieve 16.2% and 12.9% relative error reduction on two test sets, respectively. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08126">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 71	BB_Evac: Fast Location-Sensitive Behavior-Based Building Evacuation</h3><h4>Subhra Mazumdar, Arindam Pal, Francesco Parisi, V.S. Subrahmanian</h4> Abstract: Past work on evacuation planning assumes that evacuees will follow instructions -- however, there is ample evidence that this is not the case. While some people will follow instructions, others will follow their own desires. In this paper, we present a formal definition of a behavior-based evacuation problem (BBEP) in which a human behavior model is taken into account when planning an evacuation. We show that a specific form of constraints can be used to express such behaviors. We show that BBEPs can be solved exactly via an integer program called BB_IP, and inexactly by a much faster algorithm that we call BB_Evac. We conducted a detailed experimental evaluation of both algorithms applied to buildings (though in principle the algorithms can be applied to any graphs) and show that the latter is an order of magnitude faster than BB_IP while producing results that are almost as good on one real-world building graph and as well as on several synthetically generated graphs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08114">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 72	Toward Low-Cost and Stable Blockchain Networks</h3><h4>Minghong Fang, Jia Liu</h4> Abstract: Envisioned to be the future of distributed systems, blockchain networks have received increasing attentions from both industry and academic research in recent years. However, the blockchain mining process consumes vast amounts of energy, and studies have shown that the amount of energy consumed in Bitcoin mining is almost the same as electricity used in Ireland. To address the high mining energy cost problem of blockchain networks, in this paper, we propose a blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to reduce the mining cost in PoW-based (proof-of-work-based) blockchain networks. We first provide a systematic study on general blockchain queueing model. In our queueing model, transactions arrive randomly to the queue and served in a batch manner with unknown probability distribution and agnostic to any priority mechanism. Then, we leverage Lyapunov optimization techniques to propose a dynamic mining resources allocation algorithm (DMRA), which is parameterized by a tuning parameter $K>0$. We show that our algorithm achieves performance-delay tradeoff as $[O(1/K), O(K)]$. The simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRA in reducing the mining cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08027">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 73	Influence Function based Data Poisoning Attacks to Top-N Recommender  Systems</h3><h4>Minghong Fang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Jia Liu</h4> Abstract: Recommender system is an essential component of web services to engage users. Popular recommender systems model user preferences and item properties using a large amount of crowdsourced user-item interaction data, e.g., rating scores; then top-$N$ items that match the best with a user's preference are recommended to the user. In this work, we show that an attacker can launch a data poisoning attack to a recommender system to make recommendations as the attacker desires via injecting fake users with carefully crafted user-item interaction data. Specifically, an attacker can trick a recommender system to recommend a target item to as many normal users as possible. We focus on matrix factorization based recommender systems because they have been widely deployed in industry. Given the number of fake users the attacker can inject, we formulate the crafting of rating scores for the fake users as an optimization problem. However, this optimization problem is challenging to solve as it is a non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop several techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. For instance, we leverage influence function to select a subset of normal users who are influential to the recommendations and solve our formulated optimization problem based on these influential users. Our results show that our attacks are effective and outperform existing methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08025">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 74	Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking</h3><h4>Hung Le, Richard Socher, Steven C.H. Hoi</h4> Abstract: Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself. These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08024">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 75	Seasonal and Trend Forecasting of Tourist Arrivals: An Adaptive  Multiscale Ensemble Learning Approach</h3><h4>Shaolong Suna, Dan Bi, Ju-e Guo, Shouyang Wang</h4> Abstract: The accurate seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals is a very challenging task. In the view of the importance of seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals, and limited research work paid attention to these previously. In this study, a new adaptive multiscale ensemble (AME) learning approach incorporating variational mode decomposition (VMD) and least square support vector regression (LSSVR) is developed for short-, medium-, and long-term seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals. In the formulation of our developed AME learning approach, the original tourist arrivals series are first decomposed into the trend, seasonal and remainders volatility components. Then, the ARIMA is used to forecast the trend component, the SARIMA is used to forecast seasonal component with a 12-month cycle, while the LSSVR is used to forecast remainder volatility components. Finally, the forecasting results of the three components are aggregated to generate an ensemble forecasting of tourist arrivals by the LSSVR based nonlinear ensemble approach. Furthermore, a direct strategy is used to implement multi-step-ahead forecasting. Taking two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed AME learning approach can achieve higher level and directional forecasting accuracy compared with other benchmarks used in this study, indicating that our proposed approach is a promising model for forecasting tourist arrivals with high seasonality and volatility. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08021">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 76	Communication-Efficient Distributed SVD via Local Power Iterations</h3><h4>Xiang Li, Shusen Wang, Kun Chen, Zhihua Zhang</h4> Abstract: We study the distributed computing of the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). We develop an algorithm that we call \texttt{LocalPower} for improving the communication efficiency. Specifically, we uniformly partition the dataset among $m$ nodes and alternate between multiple (precisely $p$) local power iterations and one global aggregation. We theoretically show that under certain assumptions, \texttt{LocalPower} lowers the required number of communications by a factor of $p$ to reach a certain accuracy. We also show that the strategy of periodically decaying $p$ helps improve the performance of \texttt{LocalPower}. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of \texttt{LocalPower}. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08014">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 77	Tourism Demand Forecasting with Tourist Attention: An Ensemble Deep  Learning Approach</h3><h4>Shaolong Sun, Yanzhao Li, Shouyang Wang, Ju-e Guo</h4> Abstract: The large amount of tourism-related data presents a series of challenges for tourism demand forecasting, including data deficiencies, multicollinearity and long calculation time. A Bagging-based multivariate ensemble deep learning model, integrating Stacked Autoencoders and KELM (B-SAKE) is proposed to address these challenges in this study. We forecast tourist arrivals arriving in Beijing from four countries adopting historical data on tourist arrivals arriving in Beijing, economic indicators and tourist online behavior variables. The results from the cases of four origin countries suggest that our proposed B-SAKE model outperforms than benchmark models whether in horizontal accuracy, directional accuracy or statistical significance. Both Bagging and Stacked Autoencoder can improve the forecasting performance of the models. Moreover, the forecasting performance of the models is evaluated with consistent results by means of the multi-step-ahead forecasting scheme. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07964">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 78	A unified framework for 21cm tomography sample generation and parameter  inference with Progressively Growing GANs</h3><h4>Florian List, Geraint F. Lewis</h4> Abstract: Creating a database of 21cm brightness temperature signals from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) for an array of reionisation histories is a complex and computationally expensive task, given the range of astrophysical processes involved and the possibly high-dimensional parameter space that is to be probed. We utilise a specific type of neural network, a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), to produce realistic tomography images of the 21cm brightness temperature during the EoR, covering a continuous three-dimensional parameter space that models varying X-ray emissivity, Lyman band emissivity, and ratio between hard and soft X-rays. The GPU-trained network generates new samples at a resolution of $\sim 3'$ in a second (on a laptop CPU), and the resulting global 21cm signal, power spectrum, and pixel distribution function agree well with those of the training data, taken from the 21SSD catalogue \citep{Semelin2017}. Finally, we showcase how a trained PGGAN can be leveraged for the converse task of inferring parameters from 21cm tomography samples via Approximate Bayesian Computation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07940">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 79	LocoGAN -- Locally Convolutional GAN</h3><h4>≈Åukasz Struski, Szymon Knop, Jacek Tabor, Wiktor Daniec, Przemys≈Çaw Spurek</h4> Abstract: In the paper we construct a fully convolutional GAN model: LocoGAN, which latent space is given by noise-like images of possibly different resolutions. The learning is local, i.e. we process not the whole noise-like image, but the sub-images of a fixed size. As a consequence LocoGAN can produce images of arbitrary dimensions e.g. LSUN bedroom data set. Another advantage of our approach comes from the fact that we use the position channels, which allows the generation of fully periodic (e.g. cylindrical panoramic images) or almost periodic ,,infinitely long" images (e.g. wall-papers). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07897">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 80	Observational nonidentifiability, generalized likelihood and free energy</h3><h4>A.E. Allahverdyan</h4> Abstract: We study the parameter estimation problem in mixture models with observational nonidentifiability: the full model (also containing hidden variables) is identifiable, but the marginal (observed) model is not. Hence global maxima of the marginal likelihood are (infinitely) degenerate and predictions of the marginal likelihood are not unique. We show how to generalize the marginal likelihood by introducing an effective temperature, and making it similar to the free energy. This generalization resolves the observational nonidentifiability, since its maximization leads to unique results that are better than a random selection of one degenerate maximum of the marginal likelihood or the averaging over many such maxima. The generalized likelihood inherits many features from the usual likelihood, e.g. it holds the conditionality principle, and its local maximum can be searched for via suitably modified expectation-maximization method. The maximization of the generalized likelihood relates to entropy optimization. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07884">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 81	CBIR using features derived by Deep Learning</h3><h4>Subhadip Maji, Smarajit Bose</h4> Abstract: In a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System, the task is to retrieve similar images from a large database given a query image. The usual procedure is to extract some useful features from the query image, and retrieve images which have similar set of features. For this purpose, a suitable similarity measure is chosen, and images with high similarity scores are retrieved. Naturally the choice of these features play a very important role in the success of this system, and high level features are required to reduce the semantic gap. In this paper, we propose to use features derived from pre-trained network models from a deep-learning convolution network trained for a large image classification problem. This approach appears to produce vastly superior results for a variety of databases, and it outperforms many contemporary CBIR systems. We analyse the retrieval time of the method, and also propose a pre-clustering of the database based on the above-mentioned features which yields comparable results in a much shorter time in most of the cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07877">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 82	Ensemble Deep Learning on Large, Mixed-Site fMRI Datasets in Autism and  Other Tasks</h3><h4>Matthew Leming, Juan Manuel G√≥rriz, John Suckling</h4> Abstract: Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they are typically limited by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own complexity (the "black box problem"). In this paper, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI) connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterise with inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings, we additionally perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774, 0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and task vs rest, respectively. Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification. Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre dataset, finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed), and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate nucleus and paracentral sulcus. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07874">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 83	A survey of statistical learning techniques as applied to inexpensive  pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea data</h3><h4>Emily T. Winn, Marilyn Vazquez, Prachi Loliencar, Kaisa Taipale, Xu Wang, Giseon Heo</h4> Abstract: Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated 1-5% of elementary-school aged children and can lead to other detrimental health problems. Swift diagnosis and treatment are critical to a child's growth and development, but the variability of symptoms and the complexity of the available data make this a challenge. We take a first step in streamlining the process by focusing on inexpensive data from questionnaires and craniofacial measurements. We apply correlation networks, the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis, and singular value decomposition in a process of exploratory data analysis. We then apply a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques from statistics, machine learning, and topology, ranging from support vector machines to Bayesian classifiers and manifold learning. Finally, we analyze the results of each of these methods and discuss the implications for a multi-data-sourced algorithm moving forward. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07873">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 84	Online Parameter Estimation for Safety-Critical Systems with Gaussian  Processes</h3><h4>Mouhyemen Khan, Abhijit Chatterjee</h4> Abstract: Parameter estimation is crucial for modeling, tracking, and control of complex dynamical systems. However, parameter uncertainties can compromise system performance under a controller relying on nominal parameter values. Typically, parameters are estimated using numerical regression approaches framed as inverse problems. However, they suffer from non-uniqueness due to existence of multiple local optima, reliance on gradients, numerous experimental data, or stability issues. Addressing these drawbacks, we present a Bayesian optimization framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for online parameter estimation. It uses an efficient search strategy over a response surface in the parameter space for finding the global optima with minimal function evaluations. The response surface is modeled as correlated surrogates using GPs on noisy data. The GP posterior predictive variance is exploited for smart adaptive sampling. This balances the exploration versus exploitation trade-off which is key in reaching the global optima under limited budget. We demonstrate our technique on an actuated planar pendulum and safety-critical quadrotor in simulation with changing parameters. We also benchmark our results against solvers using interior point method and sequential quadratic program. By reconfiguring the controller with new optimized parameters iteratively, we drastically improve trajectory tracking of the system versus the nominal case and other solvers. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07870">PDF</a><h2>2020-02-20</h2>
<h3>No. 1	On Adaptive Attacks to Adversarial Example Defenses</h3><h4>Florian Tramer, Nicholas Carlini, Wieland Brendel, Aleksander Madry</h4> Abstract: Adaptive attacks have (rightfully) become the de facto standard for evaluating defenses to adversarial examples. We find, however, that typical adaptive evaluations are incomplete. We demonstrate that thirteen defenses recently published at ICLR, ICML and NeurIPS---and chosen for illustrative and pedagogical purposes---can be circumvented despite attempting to perform evaluations using adaptive attacks. While prior evaluation papers focused mainly on the end result---showing that a defense was ineffective---this paper focuses on laying out the methodology and the approach necessary to perform an adaptive attack. We hope that these analyses will serve as guidance on how to properly perform adaptive attacks against defenses to adversarial examples, and thus will allow the community to make further progress in building more robust models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08347">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Schoenberg-Rao distances: Entropy-based and geometry-aware statistical  Hilbert distances</h3><h4>Ga√´tan Hadjeres, Frank Nielsen</h4> Abstract: Distances between probability distributions that take into account the geometry of their sample space,like the Wasserstein or the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances have received a lot of attention in machine learning as they can, for instance, be used to compare probability distributions with disjoint supports. In this paper, we study a class of statistical Hilbert distances that we term the Schoenberg-Rao distances, a generalization of the MMD that allows one to consider a broader class of kernels, namely the conditionally negative semi-definite kernels. In particular, we introduce a principled way to construct such kernels and derive novel closed-form distances between mixtures of Gaussian distributions, among others. These distances, derived from the concave Rao's quadratic entropy, enjoy nice theoretical properties and possess interpretable hyperparameters which can be tuned for specific applications. Our method constitutes a practical alternative to Wasserstein distances and we illustrate its efficiency on a broad range of machine learning tasks such as density estimation, generative modeling and mixture simplification. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08345">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	NeuroFabric: Identifying Ideal Topologies for Training A Priori Sparse  Networks</h3><h4>Mihailo Isakov, Michel A. Kinsy</h4> Abstract: Long training times of deep neural networks are a bottleneck in machine learning research. The major impediment to fast training is the quadratic growth of both memory and compute requirements of dense and convolutional layers with respect to their information bandwidth. Recently, training `a priori' sparse networks has been proposed as a method for allowing layers to retain high information bandwidth, while keeping memory and compute low. However, the choice of which sparse topology should be used in these networks is unclear. In this work, we provide a theoretical foundation for the choice of intra-layer topology. First, we derive a new sparse neural network initialization scheme that allows us to explore the space of very deep sparse networks. Next, we evaluate several topologies and show that seemingly similar topologies can often have a large difference in attainable accuracy. To explain these differences, we develop a data-free heuristic that can evaluate a topology independently from the dataset the network will be trained on. We then derive a set of requirements that make a good topology, and arrive at a single topology that satisfies all of them. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08339">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Multiple Imputation with Denoising Autoencoder using Metamorphic Truth  and Imputation Feedback</h3><h4>Haw-minn Lu (1), Giancarlo Perrone (1), Jos√© Unpingco (1) ((1) Gary and Mary West Health Institute)</h4> Abstract: Although data may be abundant, complete data is less so, due to missing columns or rows. This missingness undermines the performance of downstream data products that either omit incomplete cases or create derived completed data for subsequent processing. Appropriately managing missing data is required in order to fully exploit and correctly use data. We propose a Multiple Imputation model using Denoising Autoencoders to learn the internal representation of data. Furthermore, we use the novel mechanisms of Metamorphic Truth and Imputation Feedback to maintain statistical integrity of attributes and eliminate bias in the learning process. Our approach explores the effects of imputation on various missingness mechanisms and patterns of missing data, outperforming other methods in many standard test cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08338">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Value-driven Hindsight Modelling</h3><h4>Arthur Guez, Fabio Viola, Th√©ophane Weber, Lars Buesing, Steven Kapturowski, Doina Precup, David Silver, Nicolas Heess</h4> Abstract: Value estimation is a critical component of the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm. The question of how to effectively learn predictors for value from data is one of the major problems studied by the RL community, and different approaches exploit structure in the problem domain in different ways. Model learning can make use of the rich transition structure present in sequences of observations, but this approach is usually not sensitive to the reward function. In contrast, model-free methods directly leverage the quantity of interest from the future but have to compose with a potentially weak scalar signal (an estimate of the return). In this paper we develop an approach for representation learning in RL that sits in between these two extremes: we propose to learn what to model in a way that can directly help value prediction. To this end we determine which features of the future trajectory provide useful information to predict the associated return. This provides us with tractable prediction targets that are directly relevant for a task, and can thus accelerate learning of the value function. The idea can be understood as reasoning, in hindsight, about which aspects of the future observations could help past value prediction. We show how this can help dramatically even in simple policy evaluation settings. We then test our approach at scale in challenging domains, including on 57 Atari 2600 games. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08329">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Variational Encoder-based Reliable Classification</h3><h4>Chitresh Bhushan, Zhaoyuan Yang, Nurali Virani, Naresh Iyer</h4> Abstract: Machine learning models provide statistically impressive results which might be individually unreliable. To provide reliability, we propose an Epistemic Classifier (EC) that can provide justification of its belief using support from the training dataset as well as quality of reconstruction. Our approach is based on modified variational auto-encoders that can identify a semantically meaningful low-dimensional space where perceptually similar instances are close in $\ell_2$-distance too. Our results demonstrate improved reliability of predictions and robust identification of samples with adversarial attacks as compared to baseline of softmax-based thresholding. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08289">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Outcome Correlation in Graph Neural Network Regression</h3><h4>Junteng Jia, Austin Benson</h4> Abstract: Graph neural networks aggregate features in vertex neighborhoods to learn vector representations of all vertices, using supervision from some labeled vertices during training. The predictor is then a function of the vector representation, and predictions are made independently on unlabeled nodes. This widely-adopted approach implicitly assumes that vertex labels are independent after conditioning on their neighborhoods. We show that this strong assumption is far from true on many real-world graph datasets and severely limits predictive power on a number of regression tasks. Given that traditional graph-based semi-supervised learning methods operate in the opposite manner by explicitly modeling the correlation in predicted outcomes, this limitation may not be all that surprising. Here, we address this issue with a simple and interpretable framework that can improve any graph neural network architecture by modeling correlation structure in regression outcome residuals. Specifically, we model the joint distribution of outcome residuals on vertices with a parameterized multivariate Gaussian, where the parameters are estimated by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the observed labels. Our model achieves substantially boosts the performance of graph neural networks, and the learned parameters can also be interpreted as the strength of correlation among connected vertices. To allow us to scale to large networks, we design linear time algorithms for low-variance, unbiased model parameter estimates based on stochastic trace estimation. We also provide a simplified version of our method that makes stronger assumptions on correlation structure but is extremely easy to implement and provides great practical performance in several cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08274">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Molecule Attention Transformer</h3><h4>≈Åukasz Maziarka, Tomasz Danel, S≈Çawomir Mucha, Krzysztof Rataj, Jacek Tabor, Stanis≈Çaw Jastrzƒôbski</h4> Abstract: Designing a single neural network architecture that performs competitively across a range of molecule property prediction tasks remains largely an open challenge, and its solution may unlock a widespread use of deep learning in the drug discovery industry. To move towards this goal, we propose Molecule Attention Transformer (MAT). Our key innovation is to augment the attention mechanism in Transformer using inter-atomic distances and the molecular graph structure. Experiments show that MAT performs competitively on a diverse set of molecular prediction tasks. Most importantly, with a simple self-supervised pretraining, MAT requires tuning of only a few hyperparameter values to achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks. Finally, we show that attention weights learned by MAT are interpretable from the chemical point of view. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08264">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	Knapsack Pruning with Inner Distillation</h3><h4>Yonathan Aflalo, Asaf Noy, Ming Lin, Itamar Friedman, Lihi Zelnik</h4> Abstract: Neural network pruning reduces the computational cost of an over-parameterized network to improve its efficiency. Popular methods vary from $\ell_1$-norm sparsification to Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this work, we propose a novel pruning method that optimizes the final accuracy of the pruned network and distills knowledge from the over-parameterized parent network's inner layers. To enable this approach, we formulate the network pruning as a Knapsack Problem which optimizes the trade-off between the importance of neurons and their associated computational cost. Then we prune the network channels while maintaining the high-level structure of the network. The pruned network is fine-tuned under the supervision of the parent network using its inner network knowledge, a technique we refer to as the Inner Knowledge Distillation. Our method leads to state-of-the-art pruning results on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using ResNet backbones. To prune complex network structures such as convolutions with skip-links and depth-wise convolutions, we propose a block grouping approach to cope with these structures. Through this we produce compact architectures with the same FLOPs as EfficientNet-B0 and MobileNetV3 but with higher accuracy, by $1\%$ and $0.3\%$ respectively on ImageNet, and faster runtime on GPU. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08258">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	Learning Global Transparent Models from Local Contrastive Explanations</h3><h4>Tejaswini Pedapati, Avinash Balakrishnan, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Amit Dhurandhar</h4> Abstract: There is a rich and growing literature on producing local point wise contrastive/counterfactual explanations for complex models. These methods highlight what is important to justify the classification and/or produce a contrast point that alters the final classification. Other works try to build globally interpretable models like decision trees and rule lists directly by efficient model search using the data or by transferring information from a complex model using distillation-like methods. Although these interpretable global models can be useful, they may not be consistent with local explanations from a specific complex model of choice. In this work, we explore the question: Can we produce a transparent global model that is consistent with/derivable from local explanations? Based on a key insight we provide a novel method where every local contrastive/counterfactual explanation can be turned into a Boolean feature. These Boolean features are sparse conjunctions of binarized features. The dataset thus constructed is consistent with local explanations by design and one can train an interpretable model like a decision tree on it. We note that this approach strictly loses information due to reliance only on sparse local explanations, nonetheless, we demonstrate empirically that in many cases it can still be competitive with respect to the complex model's performance and also other methods that learn directly from the original dataset. Our approach also provides an avenue to benchmark local explanation methods in a quantitative manner. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08247">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Optimistic Policy Optimization with Bandit Feedback</h3><h4>Yonathan Efroni, Lior Shani, Aviv Rosenberg, Shie Mannor</h4> Abstract: Policy optimization methods are one of the most widely used classes of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Yet, so far, such methods have been mostly analyzed from an optimization perspective, without addressing the problem of exploration, or by making strong assumptions on the interaction with the environment. In this paper we consider model-based RL in the tabular finite-horizon MDP setting with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. For this setting, we propose an optimistic trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithm for which we establish $\tilde O(\sqrt{S^2 A H^4 K})$ regret for stochastic rewards. Furthermore, we prove $\tilde O( \sqrt{ S^2 A H^4 } K^{2/3} ) $ regret for adversarial rewards. Interestingly, this result matches previous bounds derived for the bandit feedback case, yet with known transitions. To the best of our knowledge, the two results are the first sub-linear regret bounds obtained for policy optimization algorithms with unknown transitions and bandit feedback. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08243">PDF</a>

This example shows the huge financial impact of a working production facility for companies. Especially in the data-driven domains of Industry 4.0 and Industrial IoT with intelligent, connected machines, a conventional, static maintenance schedule seems to be old-fashioned. In this paper, we present a survey on the current state of the art in predictive maintenance for Industry 4.0.

<h3>No. 13	SYMOG: learning symmetric mixture of Gaussian modes for improved  fixed-point quantization</h3><h4>Lukas Enderich, Fabian Timm, Wolfram Burgard</h4> Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been proven to outperform classical methods on several machine learning benchmarks. However, they have high computational complexity and require powerful processing units. Especially when deployed on embedded systems, model size and inference time must be significantly reduced. We propose SYMOG (symmetric mixture of Gaussian modes), which significantly decreases the complexity of DNNs through low-bit fixed-point quantization. SYMOG is a novel soft quantization method such that the learning task and the quantization are solved simultaneously. During training the weight distribution changes from an unimodal Gaussian distribution to a symmetric mixture of Gaussians, where each mean value belongs to a particular fixed-point mode. We evaluate our approach with different architectures (LeNet5, VGG7, VGG11, DenseNet) on common benchmark data sets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and we compare with state-of-the-art quantization approaches. We achieve excellent results and outperform 2-bit state-of-the-art performance with an error rate of only 5.71% on CIFAR-10 and 27.65% on CIFAR-100. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08204">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	Federated Learning in the Sky: Joint Power Allocation and Scheduling  with UAV Swarms</h3><h4>Tengchan Zeng, Omid Semiari, Mohammad Mozaffari, Mingzhe Chen, Walid Saad, Mehdi Bennis</h4> Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms must exploit machine learning (ML) in order to execute various tasks ranging from coordinated trajectory planning to cooperative target recognition. However, due to the lack of continuous connections between the UAV swarm and ground base stations (BSs), using centralized ML will be challenging, particularly when dealing with a large volume of data. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed to implement distributed federated learning (FL) algorithms within a UAV swarm that consists of a leading UAV and several following UAVs. Each following UAV trains a local FL model based on its collected data and then sends this trained local model to the leading UAV who will aggregate the received models, generate a global FL model, and transmit it to followers over the intra-swarm network. To identify how wireless factors, like fading, transmission delay, and UAV antenna angle deviations resulting from wind and mechanical vibrations, impact the performance of FL, a rigorous convergence analysis for FL is performed. Then, a joint power allocation and scheduling design is proposed to optimize the convergence rate of FL while taking into account the energy consumption during convergence and the delay requirement imposed by the swarm's control system. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the FL convergence analysis and show that the joint design strategy can reduce the number of communication rounds needed for convergence by as much as 35% compared with the baseline design. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08196">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Using Hindsight to Anchor Past Knowledge in Continual Learning</h3><h4>Arslan Chaudhry, Albert Gordo, Puneet K. Dokania, Philip Torr, David Lopez-Paz</h4> Abstract: In continual learning, the learner faces a stream of data whose distribution changes over time. Modern neural networks are known to suffer under this setting, as they quickly forget previously acquired knowledge. To address such catastrophic forgetting, many continual learning methods implement different types of experience replay, re-learning on past data stored in a small buffer known as episodic memory. In this work, we complement experience replay with a new objective that we call anchoring, where the learner uses bilevel optimization to update its knowledge on the current task, while keeping intact the predictions on some anchor points of past tasks. These anchor points are learned using gradient-based optimization to maximize forgetting, which is approximated by fine-tuning the currently trained model on the episodic memory of past tasks. Experiments on several supervised learning benchmarks for continual learning demonstrate that our approach improves the standard experience replay in terms of both accuracy and forgetting metrics and for various sizes of episodic memories. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08165">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Gradient-Adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles for Comprehensive  Introspection of Convolutional Speech Recognition Models</h3><h4>Andreas Krug, Sebastian Stober</h4> Abstract: Deep Learning based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are very successful, but hard to interpret. To gain better understanding of how Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) accomplish their tasks, introspection methods have been proposed. Adapting such techniques from computer vision to speech recognition is not straight-forward, because speech data is more complex and less interpretable than image data. In this work, we introduce Gradient-adjusted Neuron Activation Profiles (GradNAPs) as means to interpret features and representations in Deep Neural Networks. GradNAPs are characteristic responses of ANNs to particular groups of inputs, which incorporate the relevance of neurons for prediction. We show how to utilize GradNAPs to gain insight about how data is processed in ANNs. This includes different ways of visualizing features and clustering of GradNAPs to compare embeddings of different groups of inputs in any layer of a given network. We demonstrate our proposed techniques using a fully-convolutional ASR model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08125">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Randomized Smoothing of All Shapes and Sizes</h3><h4>Greg Yang, Tony Duan, Edward Hu, Hadi Salman, Ilya Razenshteyn, Jerry Li</h4> Abstract: Randomized smoothing is a recently proposed defense against adversarial attacks that has achieved state-of-the-art provable robustness against $\ell_2$ perturbations. Soon after, a number of works devised new randomized smoothing schemes for other metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$; however, for each geometry, substantial effort was needed to derive new robustness guarantees. This begs the question: can we find a general theory for randomized smoothing? In this work we propose a novel framework for devising and analyzing randomized smoothing schemes, and validate its effectiveness in practice. Our theoretical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that for an appropriate notion of "optimal", the optimal smoothing distributions for any "nice" norm have level sets given by the *Wulff Crystal* of that norm. (2) We propose two novel and complementary methods for deriving provably robust radii for any smoothing distribution. Finally, (3) we show fundamental limits to current randomized smoothing techniques via the theory of *Banach space cotypes*. By combining (1) and (2), we significantly improve the state-of-the-art certified accuracy in $\ell_1$ on standard datasets. On the other hand, using (3), we show that, without more information than label statistics under random input perturbations, randomized smoothing cannot achieve nontrivial certified accuracy against perturbations of $\ell_\infty$-norm $\Omega(1/\sqrt d)$, when the input dimension $d$ is large.

<h3>No. 18	Hierarchical Quantized Autoencoders</h3><h4>Will Williams, Sam Ringer, Tom Ash, John Hughes, David MacLeod, Jamie Dougherty</h4> Abstract: Despite progress in training neural networks for lossy image compression, current approaches fail to maintain both perceptual quality and high-level features at very low bitrates. Encouraged by recent success in learning discrete representations with Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoders (VQ-VAEs), we motivate the use of a hierarchy of VQ-VAEs to attain high factors of compression. We show that the combination of quantization and hierarchical latent structure aids likelihood-based image compression. This leads us to introduce a more probabilistic framing of the VQ-VAE, of which previous work is a limiting case. Our hierarchy produces a Markovian series of latent variables that reconstruct high-quality images which retain semantically meaningful features. These latents can then be further used to generate realistic samples. We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations of reconstructions and samples on the CelebA and MNIST datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08111">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	Neural Networks on Random Graphs</h3><h4>Romuald A. Janik, Aleksandra Nowak</h4> Abstract: We performed a massive evaluation of neural networks with architectures corresponding to random graphs of various types. Apart from the classical random graph families including random, scale-free and small world graphs, we introduced a novel and flexible algorithm for directly generating random directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and studied a class of graphs derived from functional resting state fMRI networks. A majority of the best performing networks were indeed in these new families. We also proposed a general procedure for turning a graph into a DAG necessary for a feed-forward neural network. We investigated various structural and numerical properties of the graphs in relation to neural network test accuracy. Since none of the classical numerical graph invariants by itself seems to allow to single out the best networks, we introduced new numerical characteristics that selected a set of quasi-1-dimensional graphs, which were the majority among the best performing networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08104">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Logarithmic Regret for Learning Linear Quadratic Regulators Efficiently</h3><h4>Asaf Cassel (1), Alon Cohen (2), Tomer Koren (1) ((1) School of Computer Science, Tel Aviv University, (2) Google Research, Tel Aviv)</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of learning in Linear Quadratic Control systems whose transition parameters are initially unknown. Recent results in this setting have demonstrated efficient learning algorithms with regret growing with the square root of the number of decision steps. We present new efficient algorithms that achieve, perhaps surprisingly, regret that scales only (poly)logarithmically with the number of steps in two scenarios: when only the state transition matrix $A$ is unknown, and when only the state-action transition matrix $B$ is unknown and the optimal policy satisfies a certain non-degeneracy condition. On the other hand, we give a lower bound that shows that when the latter condition is violated, square root regret is unavoidable. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08095">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Dissecting Neural ODEs</h3><h4>Stefano Massaroli, Michael Poli, Jinkyoo Park, Atsushi Yamashita, Hajime Asama</h4> Abstract: Continuous deep learning architectures have recently re-emerged as variants of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). The infinite-depth approach offered by these models theoretically bridges the gap between deep learning and dynamical systems; however, deciphering their inner working is still an open challenge and most of their applications are currently limited to the inclusion as generic black-box modules. In this work, we "open the box" and offer a system-theoretic perspective, including state augmentation strategies and robustness, with the aim of clarifying the influence of several design choices on the underlying dynamics. We also introduce novel architectures: among them, a Galerkin-inspired depth-varying parameter model and neural ODEs with data-controlled vector fields. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08071">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	The Geometry of Sign Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Lukas Balles, Fabian Pedregosa, Nicolas Le Roux</h4> Abstract: Sign-based optimization methods have become popular in machine learning due to their favorable communication cost in distributed optimization and their surprisingly good performance in neural network training. Furthermore, they are closely connected to so-called adaptive gradient methods like Adam. Recent works on signSGD have used a non-standard "separable smoothness" assumption, whereas some older works study sign gradient descent as steepest descent with respect to the $\ell_\infty$-norm. In this work, we unify these existing results by showing a close connection between separable smoothness and $\ell_\infty$-smoothness and argue that the latter is the weaker and more natural assumption. We then proceed to study the smoothness constant with respect to the $\ell_\infty$-norm and thereby isolate geometric properties of the objective function which affect the performance of sign-based methods. In short, we find sign-based methods to be preferable over gradient descent if (i) the Hessian is to some degree concentrated on its diagonal, and (ii) its maximal eigenvalue is much larger than the average eigenvalue. Both properties are common in deep networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08056">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Progressive Identification of True Labels for Partial-Label Learning</h3><h4>Jiaqi Lv, Miao Xu, Lei Feng, Gang Niu, Xin Geng, Masashi Sugiyama</h4> Abstract: Partial-label learning is one of the important weakly supervised learning problems, where each training example is equipped with a set of candidate labels that contains the true label. Most existing methods elaborately designed learning objectives as constrained optimizations that must be solved in specific manners, making their computational complexity a bottleneck for scaling up to big data. The goal of this paper is to propose a novel framework of partial-label learning without implicit assumptions on the model or optimization algorithm. More specifically, we propose a general estimator of the classification risk, theoretically analyze the classifier-consistency, and establish an estimation error bound. We then explore a progressive identification method for approximately minimizing the proposed risk estimator, where the update of the model and identification of true labels are conducted in a seamless manner. The resulting algorithm is model-independent and loss-independent, and compatible with stochastic optimization. Thorough experiments demonstrate it sets the new state of the art. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08053">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Enlarging Discriminative Power by Adding an Extra Class in Unsupervised  Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Hai H. Tran, Sumyeong Ahn, Taeyoung Lee, Yung Yi</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation that aims at obtaining a prediction model for the target domain using labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain. There exists an array of recent research based on the idea of extracting features that are not only invariant for both domains but also provide high discriminative power for the target domain. In this paper, we propose an idea of empowering the discriminativeness: Adding a new, artificial class and training the model on the data together with the GAN-generated samples of the new class. The trained model based on the new class samples is capable of extracting the features that are more discriminative by repositioning data of current classes in the target domain and therefore drawing the decision boundaries more effectively. Our idea is highly generic so that it is compatible with many existing methods such as DANN, VADA, and DIRT-T. We conduct various experiments for the standard data commonly used for the evaluation of unsupervised domain adaptations and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves the SOTA performance for many scenarios. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08041">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Efficient Deep Reinforcement Learning through Policy Transfer</h3><h4>Tianpei Yang, Jianye Hao, Zhaopeng Meng, Zongzhang Zhang, Weixun Wang, Yujing Hu, Yingfeng Cheng, Changjie Fan, Zhaodong Wang, Jiajie Peng</h4> Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) has shown great potential to accelerate Reinforcement Learning (RL) by leveraging prior knowledge from past learned policies of relevant tasks. Existing transfer approaches either explicitly computes the similarity between tasks or select appropriate source policies to provide guided explorations for the target task. However, how to directly optimize the target policy by alternatively utilizing knowledge from appropriate source policies without explicitly measuring the similarity is currently missing. In this paper, we propose a novel Policy Transfer Framework (PTF) to accelerate RL by taking advantage of this idea. Our framework learns when and which source policy is the best to reuse for the target policy and when to terminate it by modeling multi-policy transfer as the option learning problem. PTF can be easily combined with existing deep RL approaches. Experimental results show it significantly accelerates the learning process and surpasses state-of-the-art policy transfer methods in terms of learning efficiency and final performance in both discrete and continuous action spaces. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08037">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	A Fixed point view: A Model-Based Clustering Framework</h3><h4>Jianhao Ding, Lansheng Han</h4> Abstract: With the inflation of the data, clustering analysis, as a branch of unsupervised learning, lacks unified understanding and application of its mathematical law. Based on the view of fixed point, this paper restates the model-based clustering and proposes a unified clustering framework. In order to find fixed points as cluster centers, the framework iteratively constructs the contraction map, which strongly reveals the convergence mechanism and interconnections among algorithms. By specifying a contraction map, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) can be mapped to the framework as an application. We hope the fixed point framework will help the design of future clustering algorithms. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08032">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Indirect Adversarial Attacks via Poisoning Neighbors for Graph  Convolutional Networks</h3><h4>Tsubasa Takahashi</h4> Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks, which learn aggregations over neighbor nodes, have achieved great performance in node classification tasks. However, recent studies reported that such graph convolutional node classifier can be deceived by adversarial perturbations on graphs. Abusing graph convolutions, a node's classification result can be influenced by poisoning its neighbors. Given an attributed graph and a node classifier, how can we evaluate robustness against such indirect adversarial attacks? Can we generate strong adversarial perturbations which are effective on not only one-hop neighbors, but more far from the target? In this paper, we demonstrate that the node classifier can be deceived with high-confidence by poisoning just a single node even two-hops or more far from the target. Towards achieving the attack, we propose a new approach which searches smaller perturbations on just a single node far from the target. In our experiments, our proposed method shows 99% attack success rate within two-hops from the target in two datasets. We also demonstrate that m-layer graph convolutional neural networks have chance to be deceived by our indirect attack within m-hop neighbors. The proposed attack can be used as a benchmark in future defense attempts to develop graph convolutional neural networks with having adversary robustness. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08012">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Action-Manipulation Attacks Against Stochastic Bandits: Attacks and  Defense</h3><h4>Guanlin Liu, Lifeng lai</h4> Abstract: Due to the broad range of applications of stochastic multi-armed bandit model, understanding the effects of adversarial attacks and designing bandit algorithms robust to attacks are essential for the safe applications of this model. In this paper, we introduce a new class of attack named action-manipulation attack. In this attack, an adversary can change the action signal selected by the user. We show that without knowledge of mean rewards of arms, our proposed attack can manipulate Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm, a widely used bandit algorithm, into pulling a target arm very frequently by spending only logarithmic cost. To defend against this class of attacks, we introduce a novel algorithm that is robust to action-manipulation attacks when an upper bound for the total attack cost is given. We prove that our algorithm has a pseudo-regret upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\max\{\log T,A\})$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds and $A$ is the upper bound of the total attack cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08000">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Best-item Learning in Random Utility Models with Subset Choices</h3><h4>Aadirupa Saha, Aditya Gopalan</h4> Abstract: We consider the problem of PAC learning the most valuable item from a pool of $n$ items using sequential, adaptively chosen plays of subsets of $k$ items, when, upon playing a subset, the learner receives relative feedback sampled according to a general Random Utility Model (RUM) with independent noise perturbations to the latent item utilities. We identify a new property of such a RUM, termed the minimum advantage, that helps in characterizing the complexity of separating pairs of items based on their relative win/loss empirical counts, and can be bounded as a function of the noise distribution alone. We give a learning algorithm for general RUMs, based on pairwise relative counts of items and hierarchical elimination, along with a new PAC sample complexity guarantee of $O(\frac{n}{c^2\epsilon^2} \log \frac{k}{\delta})$ rounds to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal item with confidence $1-\delta$, when the worst case pairwise advantage in the RUM has sensitivity at least $c$ to the parameter gaps of items. Fundamental lower bounds on PAC sample complexity show that this is near-optimal in terms of its dependence on $n,k$ and $c$. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07994">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 31	Being Bayesian about Categorical Probability</h3><h4>Taejong Joo, Uijung Chung, Min-Gwan Seo</h4> Abstract: Neural networks utilize the softmax as a building block in classification tasks, which contains an overconfidence problem and lacks an uncertainty representation ability. As a Bayesian alternative to the softmax, we consider a random variable of a categorical probability over class labels. In this framework, the prior distribution explicitly models the presumed noise inherent in the observed label, which provides consistent gains in generalization performance in multiple challenging tasks. The proposed method inherits advantages of Bayesian approaches that achieve better uncertainty estimation and model calibration. Our method can be implemented as a plug-and-play loss function with negligible computational overhead compared to the softmax with the cross-entropy loss function. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07965">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	Inductive Representation Learning on Temporal Graphs</h3><h4>Da Xu, Chuanwei Ruan, Evren Korpeoglu, Sushant Kumar, Kannan Achan</h4> Abstract: Inductive representation learning on temporal graphs is an important step toward salable machine learning on real-world dynamic networks. The evolving nature of temporal dynamic graphs requires handling new nodes as well as capturing temporal patterns. The node embeddings, which are now functions of time, should represent both the static node features and the evolving topological structures. Moreover, node and topological features can be temporal as well, whose patterns the node embeddings should also capture. We propose the temporal graph attention (TGAT) layer to efficiently aggregate temporal-topological neighborhood features as well as to learn the time-feature interactions. For TGAT, we use the self-attention mechanism as building block and develop a novel functional time encoding technique based on the classical Bochner's theorem from harmonic analysis. By stacking TGAT layers, the network recognizes the node embeddings as functions of time and is able to inductively infer embeddings for both new and observed nodes as the graph evolves. The proposed approach handles both node classification and link prediction task, and can be naturally extended to include the temporal edge features. We evaluate our method with transductive and inductive tasks under temporal settings with two benchmark and one industrial dataset. Our TGAT model compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines as well as the previous temporal graph embedding approaches. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07962">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Curriculum in Gradient-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Bhairav Mehta, Tristan Deleu, Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Chris J. Pal, Liam Paull</h4> Abstract: Gradient-based meta-learners such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) have shown strong few-shot performance in supervised and reinforcement learning settings. However, specifically in the case of meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL), we can show that gradient-based meta-learners are sensitive to task distributions. With the wrong curriculum, agents suffer the effects of meta-overfitting, shallow adaptation, and adaptation instability. In this work, we begin by highlighting intriguing failure cases of gradient-based meta-RL and show that task distributions can wildly affect algorithmic outputs, stability, and performance. To address this problem, we leverage insights from recent literature on domain randomization and propose meta Active Domain Randomization (meta-ADR), which learns a curriculum of tasks for gradient-based meta-RL in a similar as ADR does for sim2real transfer. We show that this approach induces more stable policies on a variety of simulated locomotion and navigation tasks. We assess in- and out-of-distribution generalization and find that the learned task distributions, even in an unstructured task space, greatly improve the adaptation performance of MAML. Finally, we motivate the need for better benchmarking in meta-RL that prioritizes \textit{generalization} over single-task adaption performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07956">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Personalized Federated Learning: A Meta-Learning Approach</h3><h4>Alireza Fallah, Aryan Mokhtari, Asuman Ozdaglar</h4> Abstract: The goal of federated learning is to design algorithms in which several agents communicate with a central node, in a privacy-protecting manner, to minimize the average of their loss functions. In this approach, each node not only shares the required computational budget but also has access to a larger data set, which improves the quality of the resulting model. However, this method only develops a common output for all the agents, and therefore, does not adapt the model to each user data. This is an important missing feature especially given the heterogeneity of the underlying data distribution for various agents. In this paper, we study a personalized variant of the federated learning in which our goal is to find a shared initial model in a distributed manner that can be slightly updated by either a current or a new user by performing one or a few steps of gradient descent with respect to its own loss function. This approach keeps all the benefits of the federated learning architecture while leading to a more personalized model for each user. We show this problem can be studied within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) framework. Inspired by this connection, we propose a personalized variant of the well-known Federated Averaging algorithm and evaluate its performance in terms of gradient norm for non-convex loss functions. Further, we characterize how this performance is affected by the closeness of underlying distributions of user data, measured in terms of distribution distances such as Total Variation and 1-Wasserstein metric. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07948">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Source Separation with Deep Generative Priors</h3><h4>Vivek Jayaram, John Thickstun</h4> Abstract: Despite substantial progress in signal source separation, results for richly structured data continue to contain perceptible artifacts. In contrast, recent deep generative models can produce authentic samples in a variety of domains that are indistinguishable from samples of the data distribution. This paper introduces a Bayesian approach to source separation that uses generative models as priors over the components of a mixture of sources, and Langevin dynamics to sample from the posterior distribution of sources given a mixture. This decouples the source separation problem from generative modeling, enabling us to directly use cutting-edge generative models as priors. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance for MNIST digit separation. We introduce new methodology for evaluating separation quality on richer datasets, providing quantitative evaluation of separation results on CIFAR-10. We also provide qualitative results on LSUN. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07942">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	Improving Generalization by Controlling Label-Noise Information in  Neural Network Weights</h3><h4>Hrayr Harutyunyan, Kyle Reing, Greg Ver Steeg, Aram Galstyan</h4> Abstract: In the presence of noisy or incorrect labels, neural networks have the undesirable tendency to memorize information about the noise. Standard regularization techniques such as dropout, weight decay or data augmentation sometimes help, but do not prevent this behavior. If one considers neural network weights as random variables that depend on the data and stochasticity of training, the amount of memorized information can be quantified with the Shannon mutual information between weights and the vector of all training labels given inputs, $I(w : \mathbf{y} \mid \mathbf{x})$. We show that for any training algorithm, low values of this term correspond to reduction in memorization of label-noise and better generalization bounds. To obtain these low values, we propose training algorithms that employ an auxiliary network that predicts gradients in the final layers of a classifier without accessing labels. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach on versions of MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 corrupted with various noise models, and on a large-scale dataset Clothing1M that has noisy labels. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07933">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction Using Variational LSTM Networks</h3><h4>Mehrdad Farahani, Marzieh Farahani, Mohammad Manthouri, Okyay Kaynak</h4> Abstract: Traffic flow characteristics are one of the most critical decision-making and traffic policing factors in a region.

<h3>No. 38	Block Switching: A Stochastic Approach for Deep Learning Security</h3><h4>Xiao Wang, Siyue Wang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xue Lin, Peter Chin</h4> Abstract: Recent study of adversarial attacks has revealed the vulnerability of modern deep learning models. That is, subtly crafted perturbations of the input can make a trained network with high accuracy produce arbitrary incorrect predictions, while maintain imperceptible to human vision system. In this paper, we introduce Block Switching (BS), a defense strategy against adversarial attacks based on stochasticity. BS replaces a block of model layers with multiple parallel channels, and the active channel is randomly assigned in the run time hence unpredictable to the adversary. We show empirically that BS leads to a more dispersed input gradient distribution and superior defense effectiveness compared with other stochastic defenses such as stochastic activation pruning (SAP). Compared to other defenses, BS is also characterized by the following features: (i) BS causes less test accuracy drop; (ii) BS is attack-independent and (iii) BS is compatible with other defenses and can be used jointly with others. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07920">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Information Condensing Active Learning</h3><h4>Siddhartha Jain, Ge Liu, David Gifford</h4> Abstract: We introduce Information Condensing Active Learning (ICAL), a batch mode model agnostic Active Learning (AL) method targeted at Deep Bayesian Active Learning that focuses on acquiring labels for points which have as much information as possible about the still unacquired points. ICAL uses the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the strength of the dependency between a candidate batch of points and the unlabeled set. We develop key optimizations that allow us to scale our method to large unlabeled sets. We show significant improvements in terms of model accuracy and negative log likelihood (NLL) on several image datasets compared to state of the art batch mode AL methods for deep learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07916">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Generating Automatic Curricula via Self-Supervised Active Domain  Randomization</h3><h4>Sharath Chandra Raparthy, Bhairav Mehta, Florian Golemo, Liam Paull</h4> Abstract: Goal-directed Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally considers an agent interacting with an environment, prescribing a real-valued reward to an agent proportional to the completion of some goal. Goal-directed RL has seen large gains in sample efficiency, due to the ease of reusing or generating new experience by proposing goals. In this work, we build on the framework of self-play, allowing an agent to interact with itself in order to make progress on some unknown task. We use Active Domain Randomization and self-play to create a novel, coupled environment-goal curriculum, where agents learn through progressively more difficult tasks and environment variations. Our method, Self-Supervised Active Domain Randomization (SS-ADR), generates a growing curriculum, encouraging the agent to try tasks that are just outside of its current capabilities, while building a domain-randomization curriculum that enables state-of-the-art results on various sim2real transfer tasks. Our results show that a curriculum of co-evolving the environment difficulty along with the difficulty of goals set in each environment provides practical benefits in the goal-directed tasks tested. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07911">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	CAUSE: Learning Granger Causality from Event Sequences using Attribution  Methods</h3><h4>Wei Zhang, Thomas Kobber Panum, Somesh Jha, Prasad Chalasani, David Page</h4> Abstract: We study the problem of learning Granger causality between event types from asynchronous, interdependent, multi-type event sequences. Existing work suffers from either limited model flexibility or poor model explainability and thus fails to uncover Granger causality across a wide variety of event sequences with diverse event interdependency. To address these weaknesses, we propose CAUSE (Causality from AttribUtions on Sequence of Events), a novel framework for the studied task. The key idea of CAUSE is to first implicitly capture the underlying event interdependency by fitting a neural point process, and then extract from the process a Granger causality statistic using an axiomatic attribution method. Across multiple datasets riddled with diverse event interdependency, we demonstrate that CAUSE achieves superior performance on correctly inferring the inter-type Granger causality over a range of state-of-the-art methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07906">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Empirical Policy Evaluation with Supergraphs</h3><h4>Daniel Vial, Vijay Subramanian</h4> Abstract: We devise and analyze algorithms for the empirical policy evaluation problem in reinforcement learning. Our algorithms explore backward from high-cost states to find high-value ones, in contrast to forward approaches that work forward from all states. While several papers have demonstrated the utility of backward exploration empirically, we conduct rigorous analyses which show that our algorithms can reduce average-case sample complexity from $O(S \log S)$ to as low as $O(\log S)$. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07905">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	Deep Transform and Metric Learning Network: Wedding Deep Dictionary  Learning and Neural Networks</h3><h4>Wen Tang, Emilie Chouzenoux, Jean-Christophe Pesquet, Hamid Krim</h4> Abstract: On account of its many successes in inference tasks and denoising applications, Dictionary Learning (DL) and its related sparse optimization problems have garnered a lot of research interest. While most solutions have focused on single layer dictionaries, the improved recently proposed Deep DL (DDL) methods have also fallen short on a number of issues. We propose herein, a novel DDL approach where each DL layer can be formulated as a combination of one linear layer and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The RNN is shown to flexibly account for the layer-associated and learned metric. Our proposed work unveils new insights into Neural Networks and DDL and provides a new, efficient and competitive approach to jointly learn a deep transform and a metric for inference applications. Extensive experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method can not only outperform existing DDL but also state-of-the-art generic CNNs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07898">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Towards Query-Efficient Black-Box Adversary with Zeroth-Order Natural  Gradient Descent</h3><h4>Pu Zhao, Pin-Yu Chen, Siyue Wang, Xue Lin</h4> Abstract: Despite the great achievements of the modern deep neural networks (DNNs), the vulnerability/robustness of state-of-the-art DNNs raises security concerns in many application domains requiring high reliability. Various adversarial attacks are proposed to sabotage the learning performance of DNN models. Among those, the black-box adversarial attack methods have received special attentions owing to their practicality and simplicity. Black-box attacks usually prefer less queries in order to maintain stealthy and low costs. However, most of the current black-box attack methods adopt the first-order gradient descent method, which may come with certain deficiencies such as relatively slow convergence and high sensitivity to hyper-parameter settings. In this paper, we propose a zeroth-order natural gradient descent (ZO-NGD) method to design the adversarial attacks, which incorporates the zeroth-order gradient estimation technique catering to the black-box attack scenario and the second-order natural gradient descent to achieve higher query efficiency. The empirical evaluations on image classification datasets demonstrate that ZO-NGD can obtain significantly lower model query complexities compared with state-of-the-art attack methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07891">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Global Convergence of Deep Networks with One Wide Layer Followed by  Pyramidal Topology</h3><h4>Quynh Nguyen, Marco Mondelli</h4> Abstract: A recent line of research has provided convergence guarantees for gradient descent algorithms in the excessive over-parameterization regime where the widths of all the hidden layers are required to be polynomially large in the number of training samples. However, the widths of practical deep networks are often only large in the first layer(s) and then start to decrease towards the output layer. This raises an interesting open question whether similar results also hold under this empirically relevant setting. Existing theoretical insights suggest that the loss surface of this class of networks is well-behaved, but these results usually do not provide direct algorithmic guarantees for optimization. In this paper, we close the gap by showing that one wide layer followed by pyramidal deep network topology suffices for gradient descent to find a global minimum with a geometric rate. Our proof is based on a weak form of Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality which holds for deep pyramidal networks in the manifold of full-rank weight matrices. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07867">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	Learning Similarity Metrics for Numerical Simulations</h3><h4>Georg Kohl, Kiwon Um, Nils Thuerey</h4> Abstract: We propose a neural network-based approach that computes a stable and generalizing metric (LSiM), to compare field data from a variety of numerical simulation sources. Our method employs a Siamese network architecture that is motivated by the mathematical properties of a metric. We leverage a controllable data generation setup with partial differential equation (PDE) solvers to create increasingly different outputs from a reference simulation in a controlled environment. A central component of our learned metric is a specialized loss function that introduces knowledge about the correlation between single data samples into the training process. To demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing simple metrics for vector spaces and other learned, image-based metrics, we evaluate the different methods on a large range of test data. Additionally, we analyze benefits for generalization and the impact of an adjustable training data difficulty. The robustness of LSiM is demonstrated via an evaluation on three real-world data sets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07863">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Is Local SGD Better than Minibatch SGD?</h3><h4>Blake Woodworth, Kumar Kshitij Patel, Sebastian U. Stich, Zhen Dai, Brian Bullins, H. Brendan McMahan, Ohad Shamir, Nathan Srebro</h4> Abstract: We study local SGD (also known as parallel SGD and federated averaging), a natural and frequently used stochastic distributed optimization method. Its theoretical foundations are currently lacking and we highlight how all existing error guarantees in the convex setting are dominated by a simple baseline, minibatch SGD. (1) For quadratic objectives we prove that local SGD strictly dominates minibatch SGD and that accelerated local SGD is minimax optimal for quadratics; (2) For general convex objectives we provide the first guarantee that at least sometimes improves over minibatch SGD; (3) We show that indeed local SGD does not dominate minibatch SGD by presenting a lower bound on the performance of local SGD that is worse than the minibatch SGD guarantee. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07839">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	Multi-Step Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning: Convergence and Improved  Algorithms</h3><h4>Kaiyi Ji, Junjie Yang, Yingbin Liang</h4> Abstract: As a popular meta-learning approach, the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm has been widely used due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, the convergence of the general multi-step MAML still remains unexplored. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical framework, under which we characterize the convergence rate and the computational complexity of multi-step MAML. Our results indicate that although the estimation bias and variance of the stochastic meta gradient involve exponential factors of $N$ (the number of the inner-stage gradient updates), MAML still attains the convergence with complexity increasing only linearly with $N$ with a properly chosen inner stepsize. We then take a further step to develop a more efficient Hessian-free MAML. We first show that the existing zeroth-order Hessian estimator contains a constant-level estimation error so that the MAML algorithm can perform unstably. To address this issue, we propose a novel Hessian estimator via a gradient-based Gaussian smoothing method, and show that it achieves a much smaller estimation bias and variance, and the resulting algorithm achieves the same performance guarantee as the original MAML under mild conditions. Our experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Hessian estimator. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07836">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 49	Deep regularization and direct training of the inner layers of Neural  Networks with Kernel Flows</h3><h4>Gene Ryan Yoo, Houman Owhadi</h4> Abstract: We introduce a new regularization method for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) based on Kernel Flows (KFs). KFs were introduced as a method for kernel selection in regression/kriging based on the minimization of the loss of accuracy incurred by halving the number of interpolation points in random batches of the dataset. Writing $f_\theta(x) = \big(f^{(n)}_{\theta_n}\circ f^{(n-1)}_{\theta_{n-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ for the functional representation of compositional structure of the ANN, the inner layers outputs $h^{(i)}(x) = \big(f^{(i)}_{\theta_i}\circ f^{(i-1)}_{\theta_{i-1}} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}_{\theta_1}\big)(x)$ define a hierarchy of feature maps and kernels $k^{(i)}(x,x')=\exp(- \gamma_i \|h^{(i)}(x)-h^{(i)}(x')\|_2^2)$. When combined with a batch of the dataset these kernels produce KF losses $e_2^{(i)}$ (the $L^2$ regression error incurred by using a random half of the batch to predict the other half) depending on parameters of inner layers $\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_i$ (and $\gamma_i$). The proposed method simply consists in aggregating a subset of these KF losses with a classical output loss. We test the proposed method on CNNs and WRNs without alteration of structure nor output classifier and report reduced test errors, decreased generalization gaps, and increased robustness to distribution shift without significant increase in computational complexity. We suspect that these results might be explained by the fact that while conventional training only employs a linear functional (a generalized moment) of the empirical distribution defined by the dataset and can be prone to trapping in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime (under over-parameterizations), the proposed loss function (defined as a nonlinear functional of the empirical distribution) effectively trains the underlying kernel defined by the CNN beyond regressing the data with that kernel. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08335">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 50	Towards Intelligent Pick and Place Assembly of Individualized Products  Using Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Caterina Neef, Dario Luipers, Jan Bollenbacher, Christian Gebel, Anja Richert</h4> Abstract: Individualized manufacturing is becoming an important approach as a means to fulfill increasingly diverse and specific consumer requirements and expectations. While there are various solutions to the implementation of the manufacturing process, such as additive manufacturing, the subsequent automated assembly remains a challenging task. As an approach to this problem, we aim to teach a collaborative robot to successfully perform pick and place tasks by implementing reinforcement learning. For the assembly of an individualized product in a constantly changing manufacturing environment, the simulated geometric and dynamic parameters will be varied. Using reinforcement learning algorithms capable of meta-learning, the tasks will first be trained in simulation. They will then be performed in a real-world environment where new factors are introduced that were not simulated in training to confirm the robustness of the algorithms. The robot will gain its input data from tactile sensors, area scan cameras, and 3D cameras used to generate heightmaps of the environment and the objects. The selection of machine learning algorithms and hardware components as well as further research questions to realize the outlined production scenario are the results of the presented work. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08333">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 51	Fawkes: Protecting Personal Privacy against Unauthorized Deep Learning  Models</h3><h4>Shawn Shan, Emily Wenger, Jiayun Zhang, Huiying Li, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y. Zhao</h4> Abstract: Today's proliferation of powerful facial recognition models poses a real threat to personal privacy. As Clearview.ai demonstrated, anyone can canvas the Internet for data, and train highly accurate facial recognition models of us without our knowledge. We need tools to protect ourselves from unauthorized facial recognition systems and their numerous potential misuses. Unfortunately, work in related areas are limited in practicality and effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Fawkes, a system that allow individuals to inoculate themselves against unauthorized facial recognition models. Fawkes achieves this by helping users adding imperceptible pixel-level changes (we call them "cloaks") to their own photos before publishing them online. When collected by a third-party "tracker" and used to train facial recognition models, these "cloaked" images produce functional models that consistently misidentify the user. We experimentally prove that Fawkes provides 95+% protection against user recognition regardless of how trackers train their models. Even when clean, uncloaked images are "leaked" to the tracker and used for training, Fawkes can still maintain a 80+% protection success rate. In fact, we perform real experiments against today's state-of-the-art facial recognition services and achieve 100% success. Finally, we show that Fawkes is robust against a variety of countermeasures that try to detect or disrupt cloaks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08327">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 52	Balancing Efficiency and Flexibility for DNN Acceleration via Temporal  GPU-Systolic Array Integration</h3><h4>Cong Guo, Yangjie Zhou, Jingwen Leng, Yuhao Zhu, Zidong Du, Quan Chen, Chao Li, Minyi Guo, Bin Yao</h4> Abstract: The research interest in specialized hardware accelerators for deep neural networks (DNN) spiked recently owing to their superior performance and efficiency. However, today's DNN accelerators primarily focus on accelerating specific "kernels" such as convolution and matrix multiplication, which are vital but only part of an end-to-end DNN-enabled application. Meaningful speedups over the entire application often require supporting computations that are, while massively parallel, ill-suited to DNN accelerators. Integrating a general-purpose processor such as a CPU or a GPU incurs significant data movement overhead and leads to resource under-utilization on the DNN accelerators. We propose Simultaneous Multi-mode Architecture (SMA), a novel architecture design and execution model that offers general-purpose programmability on DNN accelerators in order to accelerate end-to-end applications. The key to SMA is the temporal integration of the systolic execution model with the GPU-like SIMD execution model. The SMA exploits the common components shared between the systolic-array accelerator and the GPU, and provides lightweight reconfiguration capability to switch between the two modes in-situ. The SMA achieves up to 63% performance improvement while consuming 23% less energy than the baseline Volta architecture with TensorCore. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08326">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 54	Non-Aligned Distribution Distance using Metric Measure Embedding and  Optimal Transport</h3><h4>Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Maxime B√©rar, Gilles Gasso, Alain Rakotomamonjy</h4> Abstract: We propose a novel approach for comparing distributions whose supports do not necessarily lie on the same metric space. Unlike Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance that compares pairwise distance of elements from each distribution, we consider a method that embeds the metric measure spaces in a common Euclidean space and computes an optimal transport (OT) on the embedded distributions. This leads to what we call a sub-embedding robust Wasserstein(SERW). Under some conditions, SERW is a distance that considers an OT distance of the (low-distorted) embedded distributions using a common metric. In addition to this novel proposal that generalizes several recent OT works, our contributions stand on several theoretical analyses: i) we characterize the embedding spaces to define SERW distance for distribution alignment; ii) we prove that SERW mimics almost the same properties of GW distance, and we give a cost relation between GW and SERW. The paper also provides some numerical experiments illustrating how SERW behaves on matching problems in real-world. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08314">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 55	NNoculation: Broad Spectrum and Targeted Treatment of Backdoored DNNs</h3><h4>Akshaj Kumar Veldanda, Kang Liu, Benjamin Tan, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Ramesh Karri, Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, Siddharth Garg</h4> Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage defense (NNoculation) against backdoored neural networks (BadNets) that, unlike existing defenses, makes minimal assumptions on the shape, size and location of backdoor triggers and BadNet's functioning. In the pre-deployment stage, NNoculation retrains the network using "broad-spectrum" random perturbations of inputs drawn from a clean validation set to partially reduce the adversarial impact of a backdoor. In the post-deployment stage, NNoculation detects and quarantines backdoored test inputs by recording disagreements between the original and pre-deployment patched networks. A CycleGAN is then trained to learn transformations between clean validation inputs and quarantined inputs; i.e., it learns to add triggers to clean validation images. This transformed set of backdoored validation images along with their correct labels is used to further retrain the BadNet, yielding our final defense. NNoculation outperforms state-of-the-art defenses NeuralCleanse and Artificial Brain Simulation (ABS) that we show are ineffective when their restrictive assumptions are circumvented by the attacker. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08313">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 56	Multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network for image  denoising</h3><h4>Shuo-Fei Wang, Wen-Kai Yu, Ya-Xin Li</h4> Abstract: Networks with large receptive field (RF) have shown advanced fitting ability in recent years. In this work, we utilize the short-term residual learning method to improve the performance and robustness of networks for image denoising tasks. Here, we choose a multi-wavelet convolutional neural network (MWCNN), one of the state-of-art networks with large RF, as the backbone, and insert residual dense blocks (RDBs) in its each layer. We call this scheme multi-wavelet residual dense convolutional neural network (MWRDCNN). Compared with other RDB-based networks, it can extract more features of the object from adjacent layers, preserve the large RF, and boost the computing efficiency. Meanwhile, this approach also provides a possibility of absorbing advantages of multiple architectures in a single network without conflicts. The performance of the proposed method has been demonstrated in extensive experiments with a comparison with existing techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08301">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 57	MLModelScope: A Distributed Platform for Model Evaluation and  Benchmarking at Scale</h3><h4>Abdul Dakkak, Cheng Li, Jinjun Xiong, Wen-mei Hwu</h4> Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) innovations are being introduced at such a rapid pace that researchers are hard-pressed to analyze and study them. The complicated procedures for evaluating innovations, along with the lack of standard and efficient ways of specifying and provisioning ML/DL evaluation, is a major "pain point" for the community. This paper proposes MLModelScope, an open-source, framework/hardware agnostic, extensible and customizable design that enables repeatable, fair, and scalable model evaluation and benchmarking. We implement the distributed design with support for all major frameworks and hardware, and equip it with web, command-line, and library interfaces. To demonstrate MLModelScope's capabilities we perform parallel evaluation and show how subtle changes to model evaluation pipeline affects the accuracy and HW/SW stack choices affect performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08295">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 58	When Radiology Report Generation Meets Knowledge Graph</h3><h4>Yixiao Zhang, Xiaosong Wang, Ziyue Xu, Qihang Yu, Alan Yuille, Daguang Xu</h4> Abstract: Automatic radiology report generation has been an attracting research problem towards computer-aided diagnosis to alleviate the workload of doctors in recent years. Deep learning techniques for natural image captioning are successfully adapted to generating radiology reports. However, radiology image reporting is different from the natural image captioning task in two aspects: 1) the accuracy of positive disease keyword mentions is critical in radiology image reporting in comparison to the equivalent importance of every single word in a natural image caption; 2) the evaluation of reporting quality should focus more on matching the disease keywords and their associated attributes instead of counting the occurrence of N-gram. Based on these concerns, we propose to utilize a pre-constructed graph embedding module (modeled with a graph convolutional neural network) on multiple disease findings to assist the generation of reports in this work. The incorporation of knowledge graph allows for dedicated feature learning for each disease finding and the relationship modeling between them. In addition, we proposed a new evaluation metric for radiology image reporting with the assistance of the same composed graph. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the methods integrated with the proposed graph embedding module on a publicly accessible dataset (IU-RR) of chest radiographs compared with previous approaches using both the conventional evaluation metrics commonly adopted for image captioning and our proposed ones. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08277">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 59	Partial Gromov-Wasserstein with Applications on Positive-Unlabeled  Learning</h3><h4>Laetitia Chapel, Mokhtar Z. Alaya, Gilles Gasso</h4> Abstract: Optimal Transport (OT) framework allows defining similarity between probability distributions and provides metrics such as the Wasserstein and Gromov-Wasserstein discrepancies. Classical OT problem seeks a transportation map that preserves the total mass, requiring the mass of the source and target distributions to be the same. This may be too restrictive in certain applications such as color or shape matching, since the distributions may have arbitrary masses or that only a fraction of the total mass has to be transported. Several algorithms have been devised for computing unbalanced Wasserstein metrics but when it comes with the Gromov-Wasserstein problem, no partial formulation is available yet. This precludes from working with distributions that do not lie in the same metric space or when invariance to rotation or translation is needed. In this paper, we address the partial Gromov-Wasserstein problem and propose an algorithm to solve it. We showcase the new formulation in a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning application. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of optimal transport in this context and we first highlight that partial Wasserstein-based metrics prove effective in usual PU learning settings. We then demonstrate that partial Gromov-Wasserstein metrics is efficient in scenario where point clouds come from different domains or have different features. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08276">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 60	Multilogue-Net: A Context Aware RNN for Multi-modal Emotion Detection  and Sentiment Analysis in Conversation</h3><h4>Aman Shenoy, Ashish Sardana</h4> Abstract: Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Detection in conversation is key in a number of real-world applications, with different applications leveraging different kinds of data to be able to achieve reasonably accurate predictions. Multimodal Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis can be particularly useful as applications will be able to use specific subsets of the available modalities, as per their available data, to be able to produce relevant predictions. Current systems dealing with Multimodal functionality fail to leverage and capture the context of the conversation through all modalities, the current speaker and listener(s) in the conversation, and the relevance and relationship between the available modalities through an adequate fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose a recurrent neural network architecture that attempts to take into account all the mentioned drawbacks, and keeps track of the context of the conversation, interlocutor states, and the emotions conveyed by the speakers in the conversation. Our proposed model out performs the state of the art on two benchmark datasets on a variety of accuracy and regression metrics. Our model implementation is public and can be found at github.com/amanshenoy/multilogue-net <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08267">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 61	Learning Bounds for Moment-Based Domain Adaptation</h3><h4>Werner Zellinger, Bernhard A Moser, Susanne Saminger-Platz</h4> Abstract: Domain adaptation algorithms are designed to minimize the misclassification risk of a discriminative model for a target domain with little training data by adapting a model from a source domain with a large amount of training data. Standard approaches measure the adaptation discrepancy based on distance measures between the empirical probability distributions in the source and target domain. In this setting, we address the problem of deriving learning bounds under practice-oriented general conditions on the underlying probability distributions. As a result, we obtain learning bounds for domain adaptation based on finitely many moments and smoothness conditions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08260">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 62	Distance-Based Regularisation of Deep Networks for Fine-Tuning</h3><h4>Henry Gouk, Timothy M. Hospedales, Massimiliano Pontil</h4> Abstract: We investigate approaches to regularisation during fine-tuning of deep neural networks. First we provide a neural network generalisation bound based on Rademacher complexity that uses the distance the weights have moved from their initial values. This bound has no direct dependence on the number of weights and compares favourably to other bounds when applied to convolutional networks. Our bound is highly relevant for fine-tuning, because providing a network with a good initialisation based on transfer learning means that learning can modify the weights less, and hence achieve tighter generalisation. Inspired by this, we develop a simple yet effective fine-tuning algorithm that constrains the hypothesis class to a small sphere centred on the initial pre-trained weights, thus obtaining provably better generalisation performance than conventional transfer learning. Empirical evaluation shows that our algorithm works well, corroborating our theoretical results. It outperforms both state of the art fine-tuning competitors, and penalty-based alternatives that we show do not directly constrain the radius of the search space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08253">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 63	Workshop Report: Detection and Classification in Marine Bioacoustics  with Deep Learning</h3><h4>Fabio Frazao, Bruno Padovese, Oliver S. Kirsebom</h4> Abstract: On 21-22 November 2019, about 30 researchers gathered in Victoria, BC, Canada, for the workshop "Detection and Classification in Marine Bioacoustics with Deep Learning" organized by MERIDIAN and hosted by Ocean Networks Canada. The workshop was attended by marine biologists, data scientists, and computer scientists coming from both Canadian coasts and the US and representing a wide spectrum of research organizations including universities, government (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), industry (JASCO Applied Sciences, Google, Axiom Data Science), and non-for-profits (Orcasound, OrcaLab). Consisting of a mix of oral presentations, open discussion sessions, and hands-on tutorials, the workshop program offered a rare opportunity for specialists from distinctly different domains to engage in conversation about deep learning and its promising potential for the development of detection and classification algorithms in underwater acoustics. In this workshop report, we summarize key points from the presentations and discussion sessions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08249">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 64	A Unified Convergence Analysis for Shuffling-Type Gradient Methods</h3><h4>Lam M. Nguyen, Quoc Tran-Dinh, Dzung T. Phan, Phuong Ha Nguyen, Marten van Dijk</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we provide a unified convergence analysis for a class of shuffling-type gradient methods for solving a well-known finite-sum minimization problem commonly used in machine learning. This algorithm covers various variants such as randomized reshuffling, single shuffling, and cyclic/incremental gradient schemes. We consider two different settings: strongly convex and non-convex problems. Our main contribution consists of new non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates for a general class of shuffling-type gradient methods to solve both non-convex and strongly convex problems. While our rate in the non-convex problem is new (i.e. not known yet under standard assumptions), the rate on the strongly convex case matches (up to a constant) the best-known results. However, unlike existing works in this direction, we only use standard assumptions such as smoothness and strong convexity. Finally, we empirically illustrate the effect of learning rates via a non-convex logistic regression and neural network examples. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08246">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 65	Quantum statistical query learning</h3><h4>Srinivasan Arunachalam, Alex B. Grilo, Henry Yuen</h4> Abstract: We propose a learning model called the quantum statistical learning QSQ model, which extends the SQ learning model introduced by Kearns to the quantum setting. Our model can be also seen as a restriction of the quantum PAC learning model: here, the learner does not have direct access to quantum examples, but can only obtain estimates of measurement statistics on them. Theoretically, this model provides a simple yet expressive setting to explore the power of quantum examples in machine learning. From a practical perspective, since simpler operations are required, learning algorithms in the QSQ model are more feasible for implementation on near-term quantum devices. We prove a number of results about the QSQ learning model. We first show that parity functions, (log n)-juntas and polynomial-sized DNF formulas are efficiently learnable in the QSQ model, in contrast to the classical setting where these problems are provably hard. This implies that many of the advantages of quantum PAC learning can be realized even in the more restricted quantum SQ learning model. It is well-known that weak statistical query dimension, denoted by WSQDIM(C), characterizes the complexity of learning a concept class C in the classical SQ model. We show that log(WSQDIM(C)) is a lower bound on the complexity of QSQ learning, and furthermore it is tight for certain concept classes C. Additionally, we show that this quantity provides strong lower bounds for the small-bias quantum communication model under product distributions. Finally, we introduce the notion of private quantum PAC learning, in which a quantum PAC learner is required to be differentially private. We show that learnability in the QSQ model implies learnability in the quantum private PAC model. Additionally, we show that in the private PAC learning setting, the classical and quantum sample complexities are equal, up to constant factors. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08240">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 66	Physics-informed Neural Networks for Solving Nonlinear Diffusivity and  Biot's equations</h3><h4>Teeratorn Kadeethum, Thomas M Jorgensen, Hamidreza M Nick</h4> Abstract: This paper presents the potential of applying physics-informed neural networks for solving nonlinear multiphysics problems, which are essential to many fields such as biomedical engineering, earthquake prediction, and underground energy harvesting. Specifically, we investigate how to extend the methodology of physics-informed neural networks to solve both the forward and inverse problems in relation to the nonlinear diffusivity and Biot's equations. We explore the accuracy of the physics-informed neural networks with different training example sizes and choices of hyperparameters. The impacts of the stochastic variations between various training realizations are also investigated. In the inverse case, we also study the effects of noisy measurements. Furthermore, we address the challenge of selecting the hyperparameters of the inverse model and illustrate how this challenge is linked to the hyperparameters selection performed for the forward one. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08235">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 67	Learning Fair Scoring Functions: Fairness Definitions, Algorithms and  Generalization Bounds for Bipartite Ranking</h3><h4>Robin Vogel, Aur√©lien Bellet, St√©phan Cl√©men√ßon</h4> Abstract: Many applications of artificial intelligence, ranging from credit lending to the design of medical diagnosis support tools through recidivism prediction, involve scoring individuals using a learned function of their attributes. These predictive risk scores are used to rank a set of people, and/or take individual decisions about them based on whether the score exceeds a certain threshold that may depend on the context in which the decision is taken. The level of delegation granted to such systems will heavily depend on how questions of fairness can be answered. While this concern has received a lot of attention in the classification setup, the design of relevant fairness constraints for the problem of learning scoring functions has not been much investigated. In this paper, we propose a flexible approach to group fairness for the scoring problem with binary labeled data, a standard learning task referred to as bipartite ranking. We argue that the functional nature of the ROC curve, the gold standard measuring ranking performance in this context, leads to several possible ways of formulating fairness constraints. We introduce general classes of fairness conditions in bipartite ranking and establish generalization bounds for scoring rules learned under such constraints. Beyond the theoretical formulation and results, we design practical learning algorithms and illustrate our approach with numerical experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08159">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 68	Variable-Bitrate Neural Compression via Bayesian Arithmetic Coding</h3><h4>Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler, Stephan Mandt</h4> Abstract: Deep Bayesian latent variable models have enabled new approaches to both model and data compression. Here, we propose a new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing. The approach thus separates model design and training from the compression task. Our algorithm generalizes arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty. A consequence of the "plug and play" nature of our approach is that various rate-distortion trade-offs can be achieved with a single trained model, eliminating the need to train multiple models for different bit rates. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates using only a single machine learning model. Further experiments on Bayesian neural word embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08158">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 69	Bayesian Experimental Design for Implicit Models by Mutual Information  Neural Estimation</h3><h4>Steven Kleinegesse, Michael U. Gutmann</h4> Abstract: Implicit stochastic models, where the data-generation distribution is intractable but sampling is possible, are ubiquitous in the natural sciences. The models typically have free parameters that need to be inferred from data collected in scientific experiments. A fundamental question is how to design the experiments so that the collected data are most useful. The field of Bayesian experimental design advocates that, ideally, we should choose designs that maximise the mutual information (MI) between the data and the parameters. For implicit models, however, this approach is severely hampered by the high computational cost of computing posteriors and maximising MI, in particular when we have more than a handful of design variables to optimise. In this paper, we propose a new approach to Bayesian experimental design for implicit models that leverages recent advances in neural MI estimation to deal with these issues. We show that training a neural network to maximise a lower bound on MI allows us to jointly determine the optimal design and the posterior. Simulation studies illustrate that this gracefully extends Bayesian experimental design for implicit models to higher design dimensions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08129">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 70	Rnn-transducer with language bias for end-to-end Mandarin-English  code-switching speech recognition</h3><h4>Shuai Zhang, Jiangyan Yi, Zhengkun Tian, Jianhua Tao, Ye Bai</h4> Abstract: Recently, language identity information has been utilized to improve the performance of end-to-end code-switching (CS) speech recognition. However, previous works use an additional language identification (LID) model as an auxiliary module, which causes the system complex. In this work, we propose an improved recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) model with language bias to alleviate the problem. We use the language identities to bias the model to predict the CS points. This promotes the model to learn the language identity information directly from transcription, and no additional LID model is needed. We evaluate the approach on a Mandarin-English CS corpus SEAME. Compared to our RNN-T baseline, the proposed method can achieve 16.2% and 12.9% relative error reduction on two test sets, respectively. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08126">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 71	BB_Evac: Fast Location-Sensitive Behavior-Based Building Evacuation</h3><h4>Subhra Mazumdar, Arindam Pal, Francesco Parisi, V.S. Subrahmanian</h4> Abstract: Past work on evacuation planning assumes that evacuees will follow instructions -- however, there is ample evidence that this is not the case. While some people will follow instructions, others will follow their own desires. In this paper, we present a formal definition of a behavior-based evacuation problem (BBEP) in which a human behavior model is taken into account when planning an evacuation. We show that a specific form of constraints can be used to express such behaviors. We show that BBEPs can be solved exactly via an integer program called BB_IP, and inexactly by a much faster algorithm that we call BB_Evac. We conducted a detailed experimental evaluation of both algorithms applied to buildings (though in principle the algorithms can be applied to any graphs) and show that the latter is an order of magnitude faster than BB_IP while producing results that are almost as good on one real-world building graph and as well as on several synthetically generated graphs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08114">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 72	Toward Low-Cost and Stable Blockchain Networks</h3><h4>Minghong Fang, Jia Liu</h4> Abstract: Envisioned to be the future of distributed systems, blockchain networks have received increasing attentions from both industry and academic research in recent years. However, the blockchain mining process consumes vast amounts of energy, and studies have shown that the amount of energy consumed in Bitcoin mining is almost the same as electricity used in Ireland. To address the high mining energy cost problem of blockchain networks, in this paper, we propose a blockchain mining resources allocation algorithm to reduce the mining cost in PoW-based (proof-of-work-based) blockchain networks. We first provide a systematic study on general blockchain queueing model. In our queueing model, transactions arrive randomly to the queue and served in a batch manner with unknown probability distribution and agnostic to any priority mechanism. Then, we leverage Lyapunov optimization techniques to propose a dynamic mining resources allocation algorithm (DMRA), which is parameterized by a tuning parameter $K>0$. We show that our algorithm achieves performance-delay tradeoff as $[O(1/K), O(K)]$. The simulation results also demonstrate the effectiveness of DMRA in reducing the mining cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08027">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 73	Influence Function based Data Poisoning Attacks to Top-N Recommender  Systems</h3><h4>Minghong Fang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong, Jia Liu</h4> Abstract: Recommender system is an essential component of web services to engage users. Popular recommender systems model user preferences and item properties using a large amount of crowdsourced user-item interaction data, e.g., rating scores; then top-$N$ items that match the best with a user's preference are recommended to the user. In this work, we show that an attacker can launch a data poisoning attack to a recommender system to make recommendations as the attacker desires via injecting fake users with carefully crafted user-item interaction data. Specifically, an attacker can trick a recommender system to recommend a target item to as many normal users as possible. We focus on matrix factorization based recommender systems because they have been widely deployed in industry. Given the number of fake users the attacker can inject, we formulate the crafting of rating scores for the fake users as an optimization problem. However, this optimization problem is challenging to solve as it is a non-convex integer programming problem. To address the challenge, we develop several techniques to approximately solve the optimization problem. For instance, we leverage influence function to select a subset of normal users who are influential to the recommendations and solve our formulated optimization problem based on these influential users. Our results show that our attacks are effective and outperform existing methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08025">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 74	Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking</h3><h4>Hung Le, Richard Socher, Steven C.H. Hoi</h4> Abstract: Recent efforts in Dialogue State Tracking (DST) for task-oriented dialogues have progressed toward open-vocabulary or generation-based approaches where the models can generate slot value candidates from the dialogue history itself. These approaches have shown good performance gain, especially in complicated dialogue domains with dynamic slot values. However, they fall short in two aspects: (1) they do not allow models to explicitly learn signals across domains and slots to detect potential dependencies among (domain, slot) pairs; and (2) existing models follow auto-regressive approaches which incur high time cost when the dialogue evolves over multiple domains and multiple turns. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of Non-Autoregressive Dialog State Tracking (NADST) which can factor in potential dependencies among domains and slots to optimize the models towards better prediction of dialogue states as a complete set rather than separate slots. In particular, the non-autoregressive nature of our method not only enables decoding in parallel to significantly reduce the latency of DST for real-time dialogue response generation, but also detect dependencies among slots at token level in addition to slot and domain level. Our empirical results show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art joint accuracy across all domains on the MultiWOZ 2.1 corpus, and the latency of our model is an order of magnitude lower than the previous state of the art as the dialogue history extends over time. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08024">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 75	Seasonal and Trend Forecasting of Tourist Arrivals: An Adaptive  Multiscale Ensemble Learning Approach</h3><h4>Shaolong Suna, Dan Bi, Ju-e Guo, Shouyang Wang</h4> Abstract: The accurate seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals is a very challenging task. In the view of the importance of seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals, and limited research work paid attention to these previously. In this study, a new adaptive multiscale ensemble (AME) learning approach incorporating variational mode decomposition (VMD) and least square support vector regression (LSSVR) is developed for short-, medium-, and long-term seasonal and trend forecasting of tourist arrivals. In the formulation of our developed AME learning approach, the original tourist arrivals series are first decomposed into the trend, seasonal and remainders volatility components. Then, the ARIMA is used to forecast the trend component, the SARIMA is used to forecast seasonal component with a 12-month cycle, while the LSSVR is used to forecast remainder volatility components. Finally, the forecasting results of the three components are aggregated to generate an ensemble forecasting of tourist arrivals by the LSSVR based nonlinear ensemble approach. Furthermore, a direct strategy is used to implement multi-step-ahead forecasting. Taking two accuracy measures and the Diebold-Mariano test, the empirical results demonstrate that our proposed AME learning approach can achieve higher level and directional forecasting accuracy compared with other benchmarks used in this study, indicating that our proposed approach is a promising model for forecasting tourist arrivals with high seasonality and volatility. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08021">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 76	Communication-Efficient Distributed SVD via Local Power Iterations</h3><h4>Xiang Li, Shusen Wang, Kun Chen, Zhihua Zhang</h4> Abstract: We study the distributed computing of the truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). We develop an algorithm that we call \texttt{LocalPower} for improving the communication efficiency. Specifically, we uniformly partition the dataset among $m$ nodes and alternate between multiple (precisely $p$) local power iterations and one global aggregation. We theoretically show that under certain assumptions, \texttt{LocalPower} lowers the required number of communications by a factor of $p$ to reach a certain accuracy. We also show that the strategy of periodically decaying $p$ helps improve the performance of \texttt{LocalPower}. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of \texttt{LocalPower}. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.08014">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 77	Tourism Demand Forecasting with Tourist Attention: An Ensemble Deep  Learning Approach</h3><h4>Shaolong Sun, Yanzhao Li, Shouyang Wang, Ju-e Guo</h4> Abstract: The large amount of tourism-related data presents a series of challenges for tourism demand forecasting, including data deficiencies, multicollinearity and long calculation time. A Bagging-based multivariate ensemble deep learning model, integrating Stacked Autoencoders and KELM (B-SAKE) is proposed to address these challenges in this study. We forecast tourist arrivals arriving in Beijing from four countries adopting historical data on tourist arrivals arriving in Beijing, economic indicators and tourist online behavior variables. The results from the cases of four origin countries suggest that our proposed B-SAKE model outperforms than benchmark models whether in horizontal accuracy, directional accuracy or statistical significance. Both Bagging and Stacked Autoencoder can improve the forecasting performance of the models. Moreover, the forecasting performance of the models is evaluated with consistent results by means of the multi-step-ahead forecasting scheme. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07964">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 78	A unified framework for 21cm tomography sample generation and parameter  inference with Progressively Growing GANs</h3><h4>Florian List, Geraint F. Lewis</h4> Abstract: Creating a database of 21cm brightness temperature signals from the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) for an array of reionisation histories is a complex and computationally expensive task, given the range of astrophysical processes involved and the possibly high-dimensional parameter space that is to be probed. We utilise a specific type of neural network, a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), to produce realistic tomography images of the 21cm brightness temperature during the EoR, covering a continuous three-dimensional parameter space that models varying X-ray emissivity, Lyman band emissivity, and ratio between hard and soft X-rays. The GPU-trained network generates new samples at a resolution of $\sim 3'$ in a second (on a laptop CPU), and the resulting global 21cm signal, power spectrum, and pixel distribution function agree well with those of the training data, taken from the 21SSD catalogue \citep{Semelin2017}. Finally, we showcase how a trained PGGAN can be leveraged for the converse task of inferring parameters from 21cm tomography samples via Approximate Bayesian Computation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07940">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 79	LocoGAN -- Locally Convolutional GAN</h3><h4>≈Åukasz Struski, Szymon Knop, Jacek Tabor, Wiktor Daniec, Przemys≈Çaw Spurek</h4> Abstract: In the paper we construct a fully convolutional GAN model: LocoGAN, which latent space is given by noise-like images of possibly different resolutions. The learning is local, i.e. we process not the whole noise-like image, but the sub-images of a fixed size. As a consequence LocoGAN can produce images of arbitrary dimensions e.g. LSUN bedroom data set. Another advantage of our approach comes from the fact that we use the position channels, which allows the generation of fully periodic (e.g. cylindrical panoramic images) or almost periodic ,,infinitely long" images (e.g. wall-papers). <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07897">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 80	Observational nonidentifiability, generalized likelihood and free energy</h3><h4>A.E. Allahverdyan</h4> Abstract: We study the parameter estimation problem in mixture models with observational nonidentifiability: the full model (also containing hidden variables) is identifiable, but the marginal (observed) model is not. Hence global maxima of the marginal likelihood are (infinitely) degenerate and predictions of the marginal likelihood are not unique. We show how to generalize the marginal likelihood by introducing an effective temperature, and making it similar to the free energy. This generalization resolves the observational nonidentifiability, since its maximization leads to unique results that are better than a random selection of one degenerate maximum of the marginal likelihood or the averaging over many such maxima. The generalized likelihood inherits many features from the usual likelihood, e.g. it holds the conditionality principle, and its local maximum can be searched for via suitably modified expectation-maximization method. The maximization of the generalized likelihood relates to entropy optimization. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07884">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 81	CBIR using features derived by Deep Learning</h3><h4>Subhadip Maji, Smarajit Bose</h4> Abstract: In a Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) System, the task is to retrieve similar images from a large database given a query image. The usual procedure is to extract some useful features from the query image, and retrieve images which have similar set of features. For this purpose, a suitable similarity measure is chosen, and images with high similarity scores are retrieved. Naturally the choice of these features play a very important role in the success of this system, and high level features are required to reduce the semantic gap. In this paper, we propose to use features derived from pre-trained network models from a deep-learning convolution network trained for a large image classification problem. This approach appears to produce vastly superior results for a variety of databases, and it outperforms many contemporary CBIR systems. We analyse the retrieval time of the method, and also propose a pre-clustering of the database based on the above-mentioned features which yields comparable results in a much shorter time in most of the cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07877">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 82	Ensemble Deep Learning on Large, Mixed-Site fMRI Datasets in Autism and  Other Tasks</h3><h4>Matthew Leming, Juan Manuel G√≥rriz, John Suckling</h4> Abstract: Deep learning models for MRI classification face two recurring problems: they are typically limited by low sample size, and are abstracted by their own complexity (the "black box problem"). In this paper, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the largest multi-source, functional MRI (fMRI) connectomic dataset ever compiled, consisting of 43,858 datapoints. We apply this model to a cross-sectional comparison of autism (ASD) vs typically developing (TD) controls that has proved difficult to characterise with inferential statistics. To contextualise these findings, we additionally perform classifications of gender and task vs rest. Employing class-balancing to build a training set, we trained 3$\times$300 modified CNNs in an ensemble model to classify fMRI connectivity matrices with overall AUROCs of 0.6774, 0.7680, and 0.9222 for ASD vs TD, gender, and task vs rest, respectively. Additionally, we aim to address the black box problem in this context using two visualization methods. First, class activation maps show which functional connections of the brain our models focus on when performing classification. Second, by analyzing maximal activations of the hidden layers, we were also able to explore how the model organizes a large and mixed-centre dataset, finding that it dedicates specific areas of its hidden layers to processing different covariates of data (depending on the independent variable analyzed), and other areas to mix data from different sources. Our study finds that deep learning models that distinguish ASD from TD controls focus broadly on temporal and cerebellar connections, with a particularly high focus on the right caudate nucleus and paracentral sulcus. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07874">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 83	A survey of statistical learning techniques as applied to inexpensive  pediatric Obstructive Sleep Apnea data</h3><h4>Emily T. Winn, Marilyn Vazquez, Prachi Loliencar, Kaisa Taipale, Xu Wang, Giseon Heo</h4> Abstract: Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea affects an estimated 1-5% of elementary-school aged children and can lead to other detrimental health problems. Swift diagnosis and treatment are critical to a child's growth and development, but the variability of symptoms and the complexity of the available data make this a challenge. We take a first step in streamlining the process by focusing on inexpensive data from questionnaires and craniofacial measurements. We apply correlation networks, the Mapper algorithm from topological data analysis, and singular value decomposition in a process of exploratory data analysis. We then apply a variety of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques from statistics, machine learning, and topology, ranging from support vector machines to Bayesian classifiers and manifold learning. Finally, we analyze the results of each of these methods and discuss the implications for a multi-data-sourced algorithm moving forward. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07873">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 84	Online Parameter Estimation for Safety-Critical Systems with Gaussian  Processes</h3><h4>Mouhyemen Khan, Abhijit Chatterjee</h4> Abstract: Parameter estimation is crucial for modeling, tracking, and control of complex dynamical systems. However, parameter uncertainties can compromise system performance under a controller relying on nominal parameter values. Typically, parameters are estimated using numerical regression approaches framed as inverse problems. However, they suffer from non-uniqueness due to existence of multiple local optima, reliance on gradients, numerous experimental data, or stability issues. Addressing these drawbacks, we present a Bayesian optimization framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for online parameter estimation. It uses an efficient search strategy over a response surface in the parameter space for finding the global optima with minimal function evaluations. The response surface is modeled as correlated surrogates using GPs on noisy data. The GP posterior predictive variance is exploited for smart adaptive sampling. This balances the exploration versus exploitation trade-off which is key in reaching the global optima under limited budget. We demonstrate our technique on an actuated planar pendulum and safety-critical quadrotor in simulation with changing parameters. We also benchmark our results against solvers using interior point method and sequential quadratic program. By reconfiguring the controller with new optimized parameters iteratively, we drastically improve trajectory tracking of the system versus the nominal case and other solvers. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07870">PDF</a><h2>2020-02-19</h2>
<h3>No. 1	Subset Sampling For Progressive Neural Network Learning</h3><h4>Dat Thanh Tran, Moncef Gabbouj, Alexandros Iosifidis</h4> Abstract: Progressive Neural Network Learning is a class of algorithms that incrementally construct the network's topology and optimize its parameters based on the training data. While this approach exempts the users from the manual task of designing and validating multiple network topologies, it often requires an enormous number of computations. In this paper, we propose to speed up this process by exploiting subsets of training data at each incremental training step. Three different sampling strategies for selecting the training samples according to different criteria are proposed and evaluated. We also propose to perform online hyperparameter selection during the network progression, which further reduces the overall training time. Experimental results in object, scene and face recognition problems demonstrate that the proposed approach speeds up the optimization procedure considerably while operating on par with the baseline approach exploiting the entire training set throughout the training process. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07141">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Agnostic Q-learning with Function Approximation in Deterministic  Systems: Tight Bounds on Approximation Error and Sample Complexity</h3><h4>Simon S. Du, Jason D. Lee, Gaurav Mahajan, Ruosong Wang</h4> Abstract: The current paper studies the problem of agnostic $Q$-learning with function approximation in deterministic systems where the optimal $Q$-function is approximable by a function in the class $\mathcal{F}$ with approximation error $\delta \ge 0$. We propose a novel recursion-based algorithm and show that if $\delta = O\left(\rho/\sqrt{\dim_E}\right)$, then one can find the optimal policy using $O\left(\dim_E\right)$ trajectories, where $\rho$ is the gap between the optimal $Q$-value of the best actions and that of the second-best actions and $\dim_E$ is the Eluder dimension of $\mathcal{F}$. Our result has two implications: 1) In conjunction with the lower bound in [Du et al., ICLR 2020], our upper bound suggests that the condition $\delta = \widetilde{\Theta}\left(\rho/\sqrt{\mathrm{dim}_E}\right)$ is necessary and sufficient for algorithms with polynomial sample complexity. 2) In conjunction with the lower bound in [Wen and Van Roy, NIPS 2013], our upper bound suggests that the sample complexity $\widetilde{\Theta}\left(\mathrm{dim}_E\right)$ is tight even in the agnostic setting. Therefore, we settle the open problem on agnostic $Q$-learning proposed in [Wen and Van Roy, NIPS 2013]. We further extend our algorithm to the stochastic reward setting and obtain similar results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07125">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Handling Missing Annotations in Supervised Learning Data</h3><h4>Alaa E. Abdel-Hakim, Wael Deabes</h4> Abstract: Data annotation is an essential stage in supervised learning. However, the annotation process is exhaustive and time consuming, specially for large datasets. Activities of Daily Living (ADL) recognition is an example of systems that exploit very large raw sensor data readings. In such systems, sensor readings are collected from activity-monitoring sensors in a 24/7 manner. The size of the generated dataset is so huge that it is almost impossible for a human annotator to give a certain label to every single instance in the dataset. This results in annotation gaps in the input data to the adopting supervised learning system. The performance of the recognition system is negatively affected by these gaps. In this work, we propose and investigate three different paradigms to handle these gaps. In the first paradigm, the gaps are taken out by dropping all unlabeled readings. A single "Unknown" or "Do-Nothing" label is given to the unlabeled readings within the operation of the second paradigm. The last paradigm handles these gaps by giving every one of them a unique label identifying the encapsulating deterministic labels. Also, we propose a semantic preprocessing method of annotation gaps by constructing a hybrid combination of some of these paradigms for further performance improvement. The performance of the proposed three paradigms and their hybrid combination is evaluated using an ADL benchmark dataset containing more than $2.5\times 10^6$ sensor readings that had been collected over more than nine months. The evaluation results emphasize the performance contrast under the operation of each paradigm and support a specific gap handling approach for better performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07113">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Controlling Computation versus Quality for Neural Sequence Models</h3><h4>Ankur Bapna, Naveen Arivazhagan, Orhan Firat</h4> Abstract: Most neural networks utilize the same amount of compute for every example independent of the inherent complexity of the input. Further, methods that adapt the amount of computation to the example focus on finding a fixed inference-time computational graph per example, ignoring any external computational budgets or varying inference time limitations. In this work, we utilize conditional computation to make neural sequence models (Transformer) more efficient and computation-aware during inference. We first modify the Transformer architecture, making each set of operations conditionally executable depending on the output of a learned control network. We then train this model in a multi-task setting, where each task corresponds to a particular computation budget. This allows us to train a single model that can be controlled to operate on different points of the computation-quality trade-off curve, depending on the available computation budget at inference time. We evaluate our approach on two tasks: (i) WMT English-French Translation and (ii) Unsupervised representation learning (BERT). Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed Conditional Computation Transformer (CCT) is competitive with vanilla Transformers when allowed to utilize its full computational budget, while improving significantly over computationally equivalent baselines when operating on smaller computational budgets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07106">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Augmented Normalizing Flows: Bridging the Gap Between Generative Flows  and Latent Variable Models</h3><h4>Chin-Wei Huang, Laurent Dinh, Aaron Courville</h4> Abstract: In this work, we propose a new family of generative flows on an augmented data space, with an aim to improve expressivity without drastically increasing the computational cost of sampling and evaluation of a lower bound on the likelihood. Theoretically, we prove the proposed flow can approximate a Hamiltonian ODE as a universal transport map. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks of flow-based generative modeling. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07101">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Graph Deconvolutional Generation</h3><h4>Daniel Flam-Shepherd, Tony Wu, Alan Aspuru-Guzik</h4> Abstract: Graph generation is an extremely important task, as graphs are found throughout different areas of science and engineering. In this work, we focus on the modern equivalent of the Erdos-Renyi random graph model: the graph variational autoencoder (GVAE). This model assumes edges and nodes are independent in order to generate entire graphs at a time using a multi-layer perceptron decoder. As a result of these assumptions, GVAE has difficulty matching the training distribution and relies on an expensive graph matching procedure. We improve this class of models by building a message passing neural network into GVAE's encoder and decoder. We demonstrate our model on the specific task of generating small organic molecules <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07087">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	The Big Three: A Methodology to Increase Data Science ROI by Answering  the Questions Companies Care About</h3><h4>Daniel K. Griffin</h4> Abstract: Companies may be achieving only a third of the value they could be getting from data science in industry applications. In this paper, we propose a methodology for categorizing and answering 'The Big Three' questions (what is going on, what is causing it, and what actions can I take that will optimize what I care about) using data science. The applications of data science seem to be nearly endless in today's modern landscape, with each company jockeying for position in the new data and insights economy. Yet, data scientists seem to be solely focused on using classification, regression, and clustering methods to answer the question 'what is going on'. Answering questions about why things are happening or how to take optimal actions to improve metrics are relegated to niche fields of research and generally neglected in industry data science analysis. We survey technical methods to answer these other important questions, describe areas in which some of these methods are being applied, and provide a practical example of how to apply our methodology and selected methods to a real business use case. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07069">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Learning Zero-Sum Simultaneous-Move Markov Games Using Function  Approximation and Correlated Equilibrium</h3><h4>Qiaomin Xie, Yudong Chen, Zhaoran Wang, Zhuoran Yang</h4> Abstract: We develop provably efficient reinforcement learning algorithms for two-player zero-sum Markov games in which the two players simultaneously take actions. To incorporate function approximation, we consider a family of Markov games where the reward function and transition kernel possess a linear structure. Both the offline and online settings of the problems are considered. In the offline setting, we control both players and the goal is to find the Nash Equilibrium efficiently by minimizing the worst-case duality gap. In the online setting, we control a single player to play against an arbitrary opponent and the goal is to minimize the regret. For both settings, we propose an optimistic variant of the least-squares minimax value iteration algorithm. We show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and provably achieves an $\tilde O(\sqrt{d^3 H^3 T})$ upper bound on the duality gap and regret, without requiring additional assumptions on the sampling model. We highlight that our setting requires overcoming several new challenges that are absent in Markov decision processes or turn-based Markov games. In particular, to achieve optimism in simultaneous-move Marko games, we construct both upper and lower confidence bounds of the value function, and then compute the optimistic policy by solving a general-sum matrix game with these bounds as the payoff matrices. As finding the Nash Equilibrium of such a general-sum game is computationally hard, our algorithm instead solves for a Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE), which can be obtained efficiently via linear programming. To our best knowledge, such a CCE-based scheme for implementing optimism has not appeared in the literature and might be of interest in its own right. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07066">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	Retrain or not retrain? -- efficient pruning methods of deep CNN  networks</h3><h4>Marcin Pietron, Maciej Wielgosz</h4> Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) play a major role in image processing tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation. Very often CNN networks have from several to hundred stacked layers with several megabytes of weights. One of the possible methods to reduce complexity and memory footprint is pruning. Pruning is a process of removing weights which connect neurons from two adjacent layers in the network. The process of finding near optimal solution with specified drop in accuracy can be more sophisticated when DL model has higher number of convolutional layers. In the paper few approaches based on retraining and no retraining are described and compared together. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07051">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	Bit Allocation for Multi-Task Collaborative Intelligence</h3><h4>Saeed Ranjbar Alvar, Ivan V. Bajiƒá</h4> Abstract: Recent studies have shown that collaborative intelligence (CI) is a promising framework for deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based services on mobile devices. In CI, a deep neural network is split between the mobile device and the cloud. Deep features obtained at the mobile are compressed and transferred to the cloud to complete the inference. So far, the methods in the literature focused on transferring a single deep feature tensor from the mobile to the cloud. Such methods are not applicable to some recent, high-performance networks with multiple branches and skip connections. In this paper, we propose the first bit allocation method for multi-stream, multi-task CI. We first establish a model for the joint distortion of the multiple tasks as a function of the bit rates assigned to different deep feature tensors. Then, using the proposed model, we solve the rate-distortion optimization problem under a total rate constraint to obtain the best rate allocation among the tensors to be transferred. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme compared to several alternative bit allocation methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07048">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Object-based Metamorphic Testing through Image Structuring</h3><h4>Adrian Wildandyawan, Yasuharu Nishi</h4> Abstract: Testing software is often costly due to the need of mass-producing test cases and providing a test oracle for it. This is often referred to as the oracle problem. One method that has been proposed in order to alleviate the oracle problem is metamorphic testing. Metamorphic testing produces new test cases by altering an existing test case, and uses the metamorphic relation between the inputs and the outputs of the System Under Test (SUT) to predict the expected outputs of the produced test cases. Metamorphic testing has often been used for image processing software, where changes are applied to the image's attributes to create new test cases with annotations that are the same as the original image. We refer to this existing method as the image-based metamorphic testing. In this research, we propose an object-based metamorphic testing and a composite metamorphic testing which combines different metamorphic testing approaches to relatively increase test coverage. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07046">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Back-and-Forth prediction for deep tensor compression</h3><h4>Hyomin Choi, Robert A. Cohen, Ivan V. Bajic</h4> Abstract: Recent AI applications such as Collaborative Intelligence with neural networks involve transferring deep feature tensors between various computing devices. This necessitates tensor compression in order to optimize the usage of bandwidth-constrained channels between devices. In this paper we present a prediction scheme called Back-and-Forth (BaF) prediction, developed for deep feature tensors, which allows us to dramatically reduce tensor size and improve its compressibility. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art object detector demonstrate that the proposed method allows us to significantly reduce the number of bits needed for compressing feature tensors extracted from deep within the model, with negligible degradation of the detection performance and without requiring any retraining of the network weights. We achieve a 62% and 75% reduction in tensor size while keeping the loss in accuracy of the network to less than 1% and 2%, respectively. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07036">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge  Tracing</h3><h4>Youngduck Choi, Youngnam Lee, Junghyun Cho, Jineon Baek, Byungsoo Kim, Yeongmin Cha, Dongmin Shin, Chan Bae, Jaewe Heo</h4> Abstract: Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07033">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	Fully convolutional networks for structural health monitoring through  multivariate time series classification</h3><h4>Luca Rosafalco, Andrea Manzoni, Stefano Mariani, Alberto Corigliano</h4> Abstract: We propose a novel approach to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), aiming at the automatic identification of damage-sensitive features from data acquired through pervasive sensor systems. Damage detection and localization are formulated as classification problems, and tackled through Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). A supervised training of the proposed network architecture is performed on data extracted from numerical simulations of a physics-based model (playing the role of digital twin of the structure to be monitored) accounting for different damage scenarios. By relying on this simplified model of the structure, several load conditions are considered during the training phase of the FCN, whose architecture has been designed to deal with time series of different length. The training of the neural network is done before the monitoring system starts operating, thus enabling a real time damage classification. The numerical performances of the proposed strategy are assessed on a numerical benchmark case consisting of an eight-story shear building subjected to two load types, one of which modeling random vibrations due to low-energy seismicity. Measurement noise has been added to the responses of the structure to mimic the outputs of a real monitoring system. Extremely good classification capacities are shown: among the nine possible alternatives (represented by the healthy state and by a damage at any floor), damage is correctly classified in up to 95% of cases, thus showing the strong potential of the proposed approach in view of the application to real-life cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07032">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Regularizing Semi-supervised Graph Convolutional Networks with a  Manifold Smoothness Loss</h3><h4>Qilin Li, Wanquan Liu, Ling Li</h4> Abstract: Existing graph convolutional networks focus on the neighborhood aggregation scheme. When applied to semi-supervised learning, they often suffer from the overfitting problem as the networks are trained with the cross-entropy loss on a small potion of labeled data. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised manifold smoothness loss defined with respect to the graph structure, which can be added to the loss function as a regularization. We draw connections between the proposed loss with an iterative diffusion process, and show that minimizing the loss is equivalent to aggregate neighbor predictions with infinite layers. We conduct experiments on multi-layer perceptron and existing graph networks, and demonstrate that adding the proposed loss can improve the performance consistently. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07031">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Low-Rank Bottleneck in Multi-head Attention Models</h3><h4>Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Chulhee Yun, Ankit Singh Rawat, Sashank J. Reddi, Sanjiv Kumar</h4> Abstract: Attention based Transformer architecture has enabled significant advances in the field of natural language processing. In addition to new pre-training techniques, recent improvements crucially rely on working with a relatively larger embedding dimension for tokens. Unfortunately, this leads to models that are prohibitively large to be employed in the downstream tasks. In this paper we identify one of the important factors contributing to the large embedding size requirement. In particular, our analysis highlights that the scaling between the number of heads and the size of each head in the current architecture gives rise to a low-rank bottleneck in attention heads, causing this limitation. We further validate this in our experiments. As a solution we propose to set the head size of an attention unit to input sequence length, and independent of the number of heads, resulting in multi-head attention layers with provably more expressive power. We empirically show that this allows us to train models with a relatively smaller embedding dimension and with better performance scaling. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07028">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Causal Feature Discovery through Strategic Modification</h3><h4>Yahav Bechavod, Katrina Ligett, Zhiwei Steven Wu, Juba Ziani</h4> Abstract: We consider an online regression setting in which individuals adapt to the regression model: arriving individuals may access the model throughout the process, and invest strategically in modifying their own features so as to improve their assigned score. We find that this strategic manipulation may help a learner recover the causal variables, in settings where an agent can invest in improving impactful features that also improve his true label. We show that even simple behavior on the learner's part (i.e., periodically updating her model based on the observed data so far, via least-square regression) allows her to simultaneously i) accurately recover which features have an impact on an agent's true label, provided they have been invested in significantly, and ii) incentivize agents to invest in these impactful features, rather than in features that have no effect on their true label. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07024">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 18	Learning Robust Representations via Multi-View Information Bottleneck</h3><h4>Marco Federici, Anjan Dutta, Patrick Forr√©, Nate Kushman, Zeynep Akata</h4> Abstract: The information bottleneck principle provides an information-theoretic method for representation learning, by training an encoder to retain all information which is relevant for predicting the label while minimizing the amount of other, excess information in the representation. The original formulation, however, requires labeled data to identify the superfluous information. In this work, we extend this ability to the multi-view unsupervised setting, where two views of the same underlying entity are provided but the label is unknown. This enables us to identify superfluous information as that not shared by both views. A theoretical analysis leads to the definition of a new multi-view model that produces state-of-the-art results on the Sketchy dataset and label-limited versions of the MIR-Flickr dataset. We also extend our theory to the single-view setting by taking advantage of standard data augmentation techniques, empirically showing better generalization capabilities when compared to common unsupervised approaches for representation learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07017">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	Learning Group Structure and Disentangled Representations of Dynamical  Environments</h3><h4>Robin Quessard, Thomas D. Barrett, William R. Clements</h4> Abstract: Discovering the underlying structure of a dynamical environment involves learning representations that are interpretable and disentangled, which is a challenging task. In physics, interpretable representations of our universe and its underlying dynamics are formulated in terms of representations of groups of symmetry transformations. We propose a physics-inspired method, built upon the theory of group representation, that learns a representation of an environment structured around the transformations that generate its evolution. Experimentally, we learn the structure of explicitly symmetric environments without supervision while ensuring the interpretability of the representations. We show that the learned representations allow for accurate long-horizon predictions and further demonstrate a correlation between the quality of predictions and disentanglement in the latent space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06991">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	A Sparse Deep Factorization Machine for Efficient CTR prediction</h3><h4>Wei Deng, Junwei Pan, Tian Zhou, Aaron Flores, Guang Lin</h4> Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is a crucial task in online display advertising and the key part is to learn important feature interactions. The mainstream models are embedding-based neural networks that provide end-to-end training by incorporating hybrid components to model both low-order and high-order feature interactions. These models, however, slow down the prediction inference by at least hundreds of times due to the deep neural network (DNN) component. Considering the challenge of deploying embedding-based neural networks for online advertising, we propose to prune the redundant parameters for the first time to accelerate the inference and reduce the run-time memory usage. Most notably, we can accelerate the inference by 46X on Criteo dataset and 27X on Avazu dataset without loss on the prediction accuracy. In addition, the deep model acceleration makes an efficient model ensemble possible with low latency and significant gains on the performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06987">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Convergence of End-to-End Training in Deep Unsupervised Contrasitive  Learning</h3><h4>Zixin Wen</h4> Abstract: Unsupervised contrastive learning has gained increasing attention in the latest research and has proven to be a powerful method for learning representations from unlabeled data. However, little theoretical analysis was known for this framework. In this paper, we study the optimization of deep unsupervised contrastive learning. We prove that for over-parameterized neural networks, by applying end-to-end training that simultaneously updates two deep neural networks, one can find an approximate stationary solution for the non-convex contrastive loss. This result is inherently different from the existing over-parameterized analysis in the supervised setting because, in contrast to learning a specific target function, unsupervised contrastive learning tries to encode the unlabeled data distribution into the neural networks, which generally has no optimal solution. Our analysis provides theoretical insights into the practical success of these unsupervised pretraining methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06979">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	Investigating the Compositional Structure Of Deep Neural Networks</h3><h4>Francesco Craighero, Fabrizio Angaroni, Alex Graudenzi, Fabio Stella, Marco Antoniotti</h4> Abstract: The current understanding of deep neural networks can only partially explain how input structure, network parameters and optimization algorithms jointly contribute to achieve the strong generalization power that is typically observed in many real-world applications. In order to improve the comprehension and interpretability of deep neural networks, we here introduce a novel theoretical framework based on the compositional structure of piecewise linear activation functions. By defining a direct acyclic graph representing the composition of activation patterns through the network layers, it is possible to characterize the instances of the input data with respect to both the predicted label and the specific (linear) transformation used to perform predictions. Preliminary tests on the MNIST dataset show that our method can group input instances with regard to their similarity in the internal representation of the neural network, providing an intuitive measure of input complexity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06967">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Interpretable and Fair Comparison of Link Prediction or Entity Alignment  Methods with Adjusted Mean Rank</h3><h4>Max Berrendorf, Evgeniy Faerman, Laurent Vermue, Volker Tresp</h4> Abstract: In this work, we take a closer look at the evaluation of two families of methods for enriching information from knowledge graphs: Link Prediction and Entity Alignment. In the current experimental setting, multiple different scores are employed to assess different aspects of model performance. We analyze the informative value of these evaluation measures and identify several shortcomings. In particular, we demonstrate that all existing scores can hardly be used to compare results across different datasets. Moreover, this problem may also arise when comparing different train/test splits for the same dataset. We show that this leads to various problems in the interpretation of results, which may support misleading conclusions. Therefore, we propose a different evaluation and demonstrate empirically how this helps for fair, comparable and interpretable assessment of model performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06914">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	t-viSNE: Interactive Assessment and Interpretation of t-SNE Projections</h3><h4>Angelos Chatzimparmpas, Rafael Messias Martins, Andreas Kerren</h4> Abstract: t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) for the visualization of multidimensional data has proven to be a popular approach, with successful applications in a wide range of domains. Despite their usefulness, t-SNE projections can be hard to interpret or even misleading, which hurts the trustworthiness of the results. Understanding the details of t-SNE itself and the reasons behind specific patterns in its output may be a daunting task, especially for non-experts in dimensionality reduction. In this work, we present t-viSNE, an interactive tool for the visual exploration of t-SNE projections that enables analysts to inspect different aspects of their accuracy and meaning, such as the effects of hyper-parameters, distance and neighborhood preservation, densities and costs of specific neighborhoods, and the correlations between dimensions and visual patterns. We propose a coherent, accessible, and well-integrated collection of different views for the visualization of t-SNE projections. The applicability and usability of t-viSNE are demonstrated through hypothetical usage scenarios with real data sets. Finally, we present the results of a user study where the tool's effectiveness was evaluated. By bringing to light information that would normally be lost after running t-SNE, we hope to support analysts in using t-SNE and making its results better understandable. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06910">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	$œÄ$VAE: Encoding stochastic process priors with variational  autoencoders</h3><h4>Swapnil Mishra, Seth Flaxman, Samir Bhatt</h4> Abstract: Stochastic processes provide a mathematically elegant way model complex data. In theory, they provide flexible priors over function classes that can encode a wide range of interesting assumptions. In practice, however, efficient inference by optimisation or marginalisation is difficult, a problem further exacerbated with big data and high dimensional input spaces. We propose a novel variational autoencoder (VAE) called the prior encoding variational autoencoder ($\pi$VAE). The $\pi$VAE is finitely exchangeable and Kolmogorov consistent, and thus is a continuous stochastic process. We use $\pi$VAE to learn low dimensional embeddings of function classes. We show that our framework can accurately learn expressive function classes such as Gaussian processes, but also properties of functions to enable statistical inference (such as the integral of a log Gaussian process). For popular tasks, such as spatial interpolation, $\pi$VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance both in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Perhaps most usefully, we demonstrate that the low dimensional independently distributed latent space representation learnt provides an elegant and scalable means of performing Bayesian inference for stochastic processes within probabilistic programming languages such as Stan. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06873">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	Scalable Quantitative Verification For Deep Neural Networks</h3><h4>Teodora Baluta, Zheng Leong Chua, Kuldeep S. Meel, Prateek Saxena</h4> Abstract: Verifying security properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) is becoming increasingly important. This paper introduces a new quantitative verification framework for DNNs that can decide, with user-specified confidence, whether a given logical property {\psi} defined over the space of inputs of the given DNN holds for less than a user-specified threshold, {\theta}. We present new algorithms that are scalable to large real-world models as well as proven to be sound. Our approach requires only black-box access to the models. Further, it certifies properties of both deterministic and non-deterministic DNNs. We implement our approach in a tool called PROVERO. We apply PROVERO to the problem of certifying adversarial robustness. In this context, PROVERO provides an attack-agnostic measure of robustness for a given DNN and a test input. First, we find that this metric has a strong statistical correlation with perturbation bounds reported by 2 of the most prominent white-box attack strategies today. Second, we show that PROVERO can quantitatively certify robustness with high confidence in cases where the state-of-the-art qualitative verification tool (ERAN) fails to produce conclusive results. Thus, quantitative verification scales easily to large DNNs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06864">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Data and Model Dependencies of Membership Inference Attack</h3><h4>Shakila Mahjabin Tonni, Farhad Farokhi, Dinusha Vatsalan, Dali Kaafar</h4> Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used by most data-driven organisations to extract insights. Machine-learning-as-a-service (MLaaS), where models are trained on potentially sensitive user data and then queried by external parties are becoming a reality. However, recently, these systems have been shown to be vulnerable to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), where a target's data can be inferred to belong or not to the training data. While the key factors for the success of MIA have not been fully understood, existing defence mechanisms only consider the model-specific properties. We investigate the impact of both the data and ML model properties on the vulnerability of ML techniques to MIA. Our analysis indicates a strong relationship between the MIA success and the properties of the data in use, such as the data size and balance between the classes as well as the model properties including the fairness in prediction and the mutual information between the records and the model's parameters. We then propose new approaches to protect ML models from MIA by using several properties, e.g. the model's fairness and mutual information between the records and the model's parameters as regularizers, which reduces the attack accuracy by 25%, while yielding a fairer and a better performing ML model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06856">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Control Frequency Adaptation via Action Persistence in Batch  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Alberto Maria Metelli, Flavio Mazzolini, Lorenzo Bisi, Luca Sabbioni, Marcello Restelli</h4> Abstract: The choice of the control frequency of a system has a relevant impact on the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn a highly performing policy. In this paper, we introduce the notion of action persistence that consists in the repetition of an action for a fixed number of decision steps, having the effect of modifying the control frequency. We start analyzing how action persistence affects the performance of the optimal policy, and then we present a novel algorithm, Persistent Fitted Q-Iteration (PFQI), that extends FQI, with the goal of learning the optimal value function at a given persistence. After having provided a theoretical study of PFQI and a heuristic approach to identify the optimal persistence, we present an experimental campaign on benchmark domains to show the advantages of action persistence and proving the effectiveness of our persistence selection method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06836">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Class-Imbalanced Semi-Supervised Learning</h3><h4>Minsung Hyun, Jisoo Jeong, Nojun Kwak</h4> Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has achieved great success in overcoming the difficulties of labeling and making full use of unlabeled data. However, SSL has a limited assumption that the numbers of samples in different classes are balanced, and many SSL algorithms show lower performance for the datasets with the imbalanced class distribution. In this paper, we introduce a task of class-imbalanced semi-supervised learning (CISSL), which refers to semi-supervised learning with class-imbalanced data. In doing so, we consider class imbalance in both labeled and unlabeled sets. First, we analyze existing SSL methods in imbalanced environments and examine how the class imbalance affects SSL methods. Then we propose Suppressed Consistency Loss (SCL), a regularization method robust to class imbalance. Our method shows better performance than the conventional methods in the CISSL environment. In particular, the more severe the class imbalance and the smaller the size of the labeled data, the better our method performs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06815">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	Reinforcement learning for the manipulation of eye tracking data</h3><h4>Wolfgang Fuhl</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach based on reinforcement learning for eye tracking data manipulation. It is based on two opposing agents, where one tries to classify the data correctly and the second agent looks for patterns in the data, which get manipulated to hide specific information. We show that our approach is successfully applicable to preserve the privacy of a subject. In addition, our approach allows to evaluate the importance of temporal, as well as spatial, information of eye tracking data for specific classification goals. In general, this approach can also be used for stimuli manipulation, making it interesting for gaze guidance. For this purpose, this work provides the theoretical basis, which is why we have also integrated a section on how to apply this method for gaze guidance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06806">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	Equivalence of Dataflow Graphs via Rewrite Rules Using a  Graph-to-Sequence Neural Model</h3><h4>Steve Kommrusch, Th√©o Barollet, Louis-No√´l Pouchet</h4> Abstract: In this work we target the problem of provably computing the equivalence between two programs represented as dataflow graphs. To this end, we formalize the problem of equivalence between two programs as finding a set of semantics-preserving rewrite rules from one into the other, such that after the rewrite the two programs are structurally identical, and therefore trivially equivalent. We then develop the first graph-to-sequence neural network system for program equivalence, trained to produce such rewrite sequences from a carefully crafted automatic example generation algorithm. We extensively evaluate our system on a rich multi-type linear algebra expression language, using arbitrary combinations of 100+ graph-rewriting axioms of equivalence. Our system outputs via inference a correct rewrite sequence for 96% of the 10,000 program pairs isolated for testing, using 30-term programs. And in all cases, the validity of the sequence produced and therefore the provable assertion of program equivalence is computable, in negligible time. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06799">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	CAT: Customized Adversarial Training for Improved Robustness</h3><h4>Minhao Cheng, Qi Lei, Pin-Yu Chen, Inderjit Dhillon, Cho-Jui Hsieh</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training has become one of the most effective methods for improving robustness of neural networks. However, it often suffers from poor generalization on both clean and perturbed data. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, named Customized Adversarial Training (CAT), which adaptively customizes the perturbation level and the corresponding label for each training sample in adversarial training. We show that the proposed algorithm achieves better clean and robust accuracy than previous adversarial training methods through extensive experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06789">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Residual Continual Learning</h3><h4>Janghyeon Lee, Donggyu Joo, Hyeong Gwon Hong, Junmo Kim</h4> Abstract: We propose a novel continual learning method called Residual Continual Learning (ResCL). Our method can prevent the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon in sequential learning of multiple tasks, without any source task information except the original network. ResCL reparameterizes network parameters by linearly combining each layer of the original network and a fine-tuned network; therefore, the size of the network does not increase at all. To apply the proposed method to general convolutional neural networks, the effects of batch normalization layers are also considered. By utilizing residual-learning-like reparameterization and a special weight decay loss, the trade-off between source and target performance is effectively controlled. The proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art performance in various continual learning scenarios. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06774">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Differentiable Bandit Exploration</h3><h4>Craig Boutilier, Chih-Wei Hsu, Branislav Kveton, Martin Mladenov, Csaba Szepesvari, Manzil Zaheer</h4> Abstract: We learn bandit policies that maximize the average reward over bandit instances drawn from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{P}$, from a sample from $\mathcal{P}$. Our approach is an instance of meta-learning and its appeal is that the properties of $\mathcal{P}$ can be exploited without restricting it. We parameterize our policies in a differentiable way and optimize them by policy gradients - an approach that is easy to implement and pleasantly general. Then the challenge is to design effective gradient estimators and good policy classes. To make policy gradients practical, we introduce novel variance reduction techniques. We experiment with various bandit policy classes, including neural networks and a novel soft-elimination policy. The latter has regret guarantees and is a natural starting point for our optimization. Our experiments highlight the versatility of our approach. We also observe that neural network policies can learn implicit biases, which are only expressed through sampled bandit instances during training. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06772">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Last iterate convergence in no-regret learning: constrained min-max  optimization for convex-concave landscapes</h3><h4>Qi Lei, Sai Ganesh Nagarajan, Ioannis Panageas, Xiao Wang</h4> Abstract: In a recent series of papers it has been established that variants of Gradient Descent/Ascent and Mirror Descent exhibit last iterate convergence in convex-concave zero-sum games. Specifically, \cite{DISZ17, LiangS18} show last iterate convergence of the so called "Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent" for the case of \textit{unconstrained} min-max optimization. Moreover, in \cite{Metal} the authors show that Mirror Descent with an extra gradient step displays last iterate convergence for convex-concave problems (both constrained and unconstrained), though their algorithm does not follow the online learning framework; it uses extra information rather than \textit{only} the history to compute the next iteration. In this work, we show that "Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update (OMWU)" which follows the no-regret online learning framework, exhibits last iterate convergence locally for convex-concave games, generalizing the results of \cite{DP19} where last iterate convergence of OMWU was shown only for the \textit{bilinear case}. We complement our results with experiments that indicate fast convergence of the method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06768">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	Hybrid Embedded Deep Stacked Sparse Autoencoder with w_LPPD SVM Ensemble</h3><h4>Yongming Li, Yan Lei, Pin Wang, Yuchuan Liu</h4> Abstract: Deep learning is a kind of feature learning method with strong nonliear feature transformation and becomes more and more important in many fields of artificial intelligence. Deep autoencoder is one representative method of the deep learning methods, and can effectively extract abstract the information of datasets. However, it does not consider the complementarity between the deep features and original features during deep feature transformation. Besides, it suffers from small sample problem. In order to solve these problems, a novel deep autoencoder - hybrid feature embedded stacked sparse autoencoder(HESSAE) has been proposed in this paper. HFESAE is capable to learn discriminant deep features with the help of embedding original features to filter weak hidden-layer outputs during training. For the issue that class representation ability of abstract information is limited by small sample problem, a feature fusion strategy has been designed aiming to combining abstract information learned by HFESAE with original feature and obtain hybrid features for feature reduction. The strategy is hybrid feature selection strategy based on L1 regularization followed by an support vector machine(SVM) ensemble model, in which weighted local discriminant preservation projection (w_LPPD), is designed and employed on each base classifier. At the end of this paper, several representative public datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that, the proposed feature learning method yields superior performance compared to other existing and state of art feature learning algorithms including some representative deep autoencoder methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06761">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	Entity Context and Relational Paths for Knowledge Graph Completion</h3><h4>Hongwei Wang, Hongyu Ren, Jure Leskovec</h4> Abstract: Knowledge graph completion aims to predict missing relations between entities in a knowledge graph. While many different methods have been proposed, there is a lack of a unifying framework that would lead to state-of-the-art results. Here we develop PathCon, a knowledge graph completion method that harnesses four novel insights to outperform existing methods. PathCon predicts relations between a pair of entities by: (1) Considering the Relational Context of each entity by capturing the relation types adjacent to the entity and modeled through a novel edge-based message passing scheme; (2) Considering the Relational Paths capturing all paths between the two entities; And, (3) adaptively integrating the Relational Context and Relational Path through a learnable attention mechanism. Importantly, (4) in contrast to conventional node-based representations, PathCon represents context and path only using the relation types, which makes it applicable in an inductive setting. Experimental results on knowledge graph benchmarks as well as our newly proposed dataset show that PathCon outperforms state-of-the-art knowledge graph completion methods by a large margin. Finally, PathCon is able to provide interpretable explanations by identifying relations that provide the context and paths that are important for a given predicted relation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06757">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	Unifying Graph Convolutional Neural Networks and Label Propagation</h3><h4>Hongwei Wang, Jure Leskovec</h4> Abstract: Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node classification but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information. However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how the feature/label of one node is spread over its neighbors; And, (2) feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented than existing feature-based attention models. In a number of experiments on real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art GCN-based methods in terms of node classification accuracy. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06755">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Unraveling Meta-Learning: Understanding Feature Representations for  Few-Shot Tasks</h3><h4>Micah Goldblum, Steven Reich, Liam Fowl, Renkun Ni, Valeriia Cherepanova, Tom Goldstein</h4> Abstract: Meta-learning algorithms produce feature extractors which achieve state-of-the-art performance on few-shot classification. While the literature is rich with meta-learning methods, little is known about why the resulting feature extractors perform so well. We develop a better understanding of the underlying mechanics of meta-learning and the difference between models trained using meta-learning and models which are trained classically. In doing so, we develop several hypotheses for why meta-learned models perform better. In addition to visualizations, we design several regularizers inspired by our hypotheses which improve performance on few-shot classification. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06753">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Learning Individually Fair Classifier with Causal-Effect Constraint</h3><h4>Yoichi Chikahara, Shinsaku Sakaue, Akinori Fujino</h4> Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly being used in various applications that make decisions for individuals. For such applications, we need to strike a balance between achieving good prediction accuracy and making fair decisions with respect to a sensitive feature (e.g., race or gender), which is difficult in complex real-world scenarios. Existing methods measure the unfairness in such scenarios as {\it unfair causal effects} and constrain its mean to zero. Unfortunately, with these methods, the decisions are not necessarily fair for all individuals because even when the mean unfair effect is zero, unfair effects might be positive for some individuals and negative for others, which is discriminatory for them. To learn a classifier that is fair for all individuals, we define unfairness as the {\it probability of individual unfairness} (PIU) and propose to solve an optimization problem that constrains an upper bound on PIU. We theoretically illustrate why our method achieves individual fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method learns an individually fair classifier at a slight cost of prediction accuracy. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06746">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	Multiple Flat Projections for Cross-manifold Clustering</h3><h4>Lan Bai, Yuan-Hai Shao, Wei-Jie Chen, Zhen Wang, Nai-Yang Deng</h4> Abstract: Cross-manifold clustering is a hard topic and many traditional clustering methods fail because of the cross-manifold structures. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Flat Projections Clustering (MFPC) to deal with cross-manifold clustering problems. In our MFPC, the given samples are projected into multiple subspaces to discover the global structures of the implicit manifolds. Thus, the cross-manifold clusters are distinguished from the various projections. Further, our MFPC is extended to nonlinear manifold clustering via kernel tricks to deal with more complex cross-manifold clustering. A series of non-convex matrix optimization problems in MFPC are solved by a proposed recursive algorithm. The synthetic tests show that our MFPC works on the cross-manifold structures well. Moreover, experimental results on the benchmark datasets show the excellent performance of our MFPC compared with some state-of-the-art clustering methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06739">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Reward Design for Driver Repositioning Using Multi-Agent Reinforcement  Learning</h3><h4>Zhenyu Shou, Xuan Di</h4> Abstract: A large portion of the passenger requests is reportedly unserviced, partially due to vacant for-hire drivers' cruising behavior during the passenger seeking process. This paper aims to model the multi-driver repositioning task through a mean field multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach. Noticing that the direct application of MARL to the multi-driver system under a given reward mechanism will very likely yield a suboptimal equilibrium due to the selfishness of drivers, this study proposes a reward design scheme with which a more desired equilibrium can be reached. To effectively solve the bilevel optimization problem with upper level as the reward design and the lower level as a multi-agent system (MAS), a Bayesian optimization algorithm is adopted to speed up the learning process. We then use a synthetic dataset to test the proposed model. The results show that the weighted average of order response rate and overall service charge can be improved by 4% using a simple platform service charge, compared with that of no reward design. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06723">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	Predicting trends in the quality of state-of-the-art neural networks  without access to training or testing data</h3><h4>Charles H. Martin, Tongsu (Serena)Peng, Michael W. Mahoney</h4> Abstract: In many applications, one works with deep neural network (DNN) models trained by someone else. For such pretrained models, one typically does not have access to training/test data. Moreover, one does not know many details about the model, such as the specifics of the training data, the loss function, the hyperparameter values, etc. Given one or many pretrained models, can one say anything about the expected performance or quality of the models? Here, we present and evaluate empirical quality metrics for pretrained DNN models at scale. Using the open-source WeightWatcher tool, we analyze hundreds of publicly-available pretrained models, including older and current state-of-the-art models in CV and NLP. We examine norm-based capacity control metrics as well as newer Power Law (PL) based metrics (including fitted PL exponents and a Weighted Alpha metric), from the recently-developed Theory of Heavy-Tailed Self Regularization. Norm-based metrics correlate well with reported test accuracies for well-trained models across nearly all CV architecture series. On the other hand, norm-based metrics can not distinguish "good-versus-bad" models---which, arguably is the point of needing quality metrics. Indeed, they may give spurious results. PL-based metrics do much better---quantitatively better at discriminating series of "good-better-best" models, and qualitatively better at discriminating "good-versus-bad" models. PL-based metrics can also be used to characterize fine-scale properties of models, and we introduce the layer-wise Correlation Flow as new quality assessment. We show how poorly-trained (and/or poorly fine-tuned) models may exhibit both Scale Collapse and unusually large PL exponents, in particular for recent NLP models. Our techniques can be used to identify when a pretrained DNN has problems that can not be detected simply by examining training/test accuracies. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06716">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	BatchEnsemble: an Alternative Approach to Efficient Ensemble and  Lifelong Learning</h3><h4>Yeming Wen, Dustin Tran, Jimmy Ba</h4> Abstract: Ensembles, where multiple neural networks are trained individually and their predictions are averaged, have been shown to be widely successful for improving both the accuracy and predictive uncertainty of single neural networks. However, an ensemble's cost for both training and testing increases linearly with the number of networks, which quickly becomes untenable. In this paper, we propose BatchEnsemble, an ensemble method whose computational and memory costs are significantly lower than typical ensembles. BatchEnsemble achieves this by defining each weight matrix to be the Hadamard product of a shared weight among all ensemble members and a rank-one matrix per member. Unlike ensembles, BatchEnsemble is not only parallelizable across devices, where one device trains one member, but also parallelizable within a device, where multiple ensemble members are updated simultaneously for a given mini-batch. Across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, WMT14 EN-DE/EN-FR translation, and out-of-distribution tasks, BatchEnsemble yields competitive accuracy and uncertainties as typical ensembles; the speedup at test time is 3X and memory reduction is 3X at an ensemble of size 4. We also apply BatchEnsemble to lifelong learning, where on Split-CIFAR-100, BatchEnsemble yields comparable performance to progressive neural networks while having a much lower computational and memory costs. We further show that BatchEnsemble can easily scale up to lifelong learning on Split-ImageNet which involves 100 sequential learning tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06715">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Investigating Simple Object Representations in Model-Free Deep  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Guy Davidson, Brenden M. Lake</h4> Abstract: We explore the benefits of augmenting state-of-the-art model-free deep reinforcement algorithms with simple object representations. Following the Frostbite challenge posited by Lake et al. (2017), we identify object representations as a critical cognitive capacity lacking from current reinforcement learning agents. We discover that providing the Rainbow model (Hessel et al.,2018) with simple, feature-engineered object representations substantially boosts its performance on the Frostbite game from Atari 2600. We then analyze the relative contributions of the representations of different types of objects, identify environment states where these representations are most impactful, and examine how these representations aid in generalizing to novel situations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06703">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	Performative Prediction</h3><h4>Juan C. Perdomo, Tijana Zrnic, Celestine Mendler-D√ºnner, Moritz Hardt</h4> Abstract: When predictions support decisions they may influence the outcome they aim to predict. We call such predictions performative; the prediction influences the target. Performativity is a well-studied phenomenon in policy-making that has so far been neglected in supervised learning. When ignored, performativity surfaces as undesirable distribution shift, routinely addressed with retraining. We develop a risk minimization framework for performative prediction bringing together concepts from statistics, game theory, and causality. A conceptual novelty is an equilibrium notion we call performative stability. Performative stability implies that the predictions are calibrated not against past outcomes, but against the future outcomes that manifest from acting on the prediction. Our main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the convergence of retraining to a performatively stable point of nearly minimal loss. In full generality, performative prediction strictly subsumes the setting known as strategic classification. We thus also give the first sufficient conditions for retraining to overcome strategic feedback effects. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06673">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Over-parameterized Adversarial Training: An Analysis Overcoming the  Curse of Dimensionality</h3><h4>Yi Zhang, Orestis Plevrakis, Simon S. Du, Xingguo Li, Zhao Song, Sanjeev Arora</h4> Abstract: Adversarial training is a popular method to give neural nets robustness against adversarial perturbations. In practice adversarial training leads to low robust training loss. However, a rigorous explanation for why this happens under natural conditions is still missing. Recently a convergence theory for standard (non-adversarial) supervised training was developed by various groups for {\em very overparametrized} nets. It is unclear how to extend these results to adversarial training because of the min-max objective. Recently, a first step towards this direction was made by Gao et al. using tools from online learning, but they require the width of the net to be \emph{exponential} in input dimension $d$, and with an unnatural activation function. Our work proves convergence to low robust training loss for \emph{polynomial} width instead of exponential, under natural assumptions and with the ReLU activation. Key element of our proof is showing that ReLU networks near initialization can approximate the step function, which may be of independent interest. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06668">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	TempLe: Learning Template of Transitions for Sample Efficient Multi-task  RL</h3><h4>Yanchao Sun, Xiangyu Yin, Furong Huang</h4> Abstract: Transferring knowledge among various environments is important to efficiently learn multiple tasks online. Most existing methods directly use the previously learned models or previously learned optimal policies to learn new tasks. However, these methods may be inefficient when the underlying models or optimal policies are substantially different across tasks. In this paper, we propose Template Learning (TempLe), the first PAC-MDP method for multi-task reinforcement learning that could be applied to tasks with varying state/action space. TempLe generates transition dynamics templates, abstractions of the transition dynamics across tasks, to gain sample efficiency by extracting similarities between tasks even when their underlying models or optimal policies have limited commonalities. We present two algorithms for an "online" and a "finite-model" setting respectively. We prove that our proposed TempLe algorithms achieve much lower sample complexity than single-task learners or state-of-the-art multi-task methods. We show via systematically designed experiments that our TempLe method universally outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-task methods (PAC-MDP or not) in various settings and regimes. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06659">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 49	Robustness Verification for Transformers</h3><h4>Zhouxing Shi, Huan Zhang, Kai-Wei Chang, Minlie Huang, Cho-Jui Hsieh</h4> Abstract: Robustness verification that aims to formally certify the prediction behavior of neural networks has become an important tool for understanding model behavior and obtaining safety guarantees. However, previous methods can usually only handle neural networks with relatively simple architectures. In this paper, we consider the robustness verification problem for Transformers. Transformers have complex self-attention layers that pose many challenges for verification, including cross-nonlinearity and cross-position dependency, which have not been discussed in previous works. We resolve these challenges and develop the first robustness verification algorithm for Transformers. The certified robustness bounds computed by our method are significantly tighter than those by naive Interval Bound Propagation. These bounds also shed light on interpreting Transformers as they consistently reflect the importance of different words in sentiment analysis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06622">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 50	Controlled time series generation for automotive software-in-the-loop  testing using GANs</h3><h4>Dhasarathy Parthasarathy, Karl B√§ckstr√∂m, Jens Henriksson, S√≥lr√∫n Einarsd√≥ttir</h4> Abstract: Testing automotive mechatronic systems partly uses the software-in-the-loop approach, where systematically covering inputs of the system-under-test remains a major challenge. In current practice, there are two major techniques of input stimulation. One approach is to craft input sequences which eases control and feedback of the test process but falls short of exposing the system to realistic scenarios. The other is to replay sequences recorded from field operations which accounts for reality but requires collecting a well-labeled dataset of sufficient capacity for widespread use, which is expensive. This work applies the well-known unsupervised learning framework of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to learn an unlabeled dataset of recorded in-vehicle signals and uses it for generation of synthetic input stimuli. Additionally, a metric-based linear interpolation algorithm is demonstrated, which guarantees that generated stimuli follow a customizable similarity relationship with specified references. This combination of techniques enables controlled generation of a rich range of meaningful and realistic input patterns, improving virtual test coverage and reducing the need for expensive field tests. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06611">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 51	REST: Performance Improvement of a Black Box Model via RL-based Spatial  Transformation</h3><h4>Jae Myung Kim, Hyungjin Kim, Chanwoo Park, Jungwoo Lee</h4> Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) have become a highly active area of research, and shown remarkable achievements on a variety of computer vision tasks. DNNs, however, are known to often make overconfident yet incorrect predictions on out-of-distribution samples, which can be a major obstacle to real-world deployments because the training dataset is always limited compared to diverse real-world samples. Thus, it is fundamental to provide guarantees of robustness to the distribution shift between training and test time when we construct DNN models in practice. Moreover, in many cases, the deep learning models are deployed as black boxes and the performance has been already optimized for a training dataset, thus changing the black box itself can lead to performance degradation. We here study the robustness to the geometric transformations in a specific condition where the black-box image classifier is given. We propose an additional learner, \emph{REinforcement Spatial Transform learner (REST)}, that transforms the warped input data into samples regarded as in-distribution by the black-box models. Our work aims to improve the robustness by adding a REST module in front of any black boxes and training only the REST module without retraining the original black box model in an end-to-end manner, i.e. we try to convert the real-world data into training distribution which the performance of the black-box model is best suited for. We use a confidence score that is obtained from the black-box model to determine whether the transformed input is drawn from in-distribution. We empirically show that our method has an advantage in generalization to geometric transformations and sample efficiency. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06610">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 52	Generalized Embedding Machines for Recommender Systems</h3><h4>Enneng Yang, Xin Xin, Li Shen, Guibing Guo</h4> Abstract: Factorization machine (FM) is an effective model for feature-based recommendation which utilizes inner product to capture second-order feature interactions. However, one of the major drawbacks of FM is that it couldn't capture complex high-order interaction signals. A common solution is to change the interaction function, such as stacking deep neural networks on the top of FM. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to model high-order interaction signals in the embedding level, namely Generalized Embedding Machine (GEM). The embedding used in GEM encodes not only the information from the feature itself but also the information from other correlated features. Under such situation, the embedding becomes high-order. Then we can incorporate GEM with FM and even its advanced variants to perform feature interactions. More specifically, in this paper we utilize graph convolution networks (GCN) to generate high-order embeddings. We integrate GEM with several FM-based models and conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. The results demonstrate significant improvement of GEM over corresponding baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06561">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 53	Fair Principal Component Analysis and Filter Design</h3><h4>Gad Zalcberg, Ami Wiesel</h4> Abstract: We consider Fair Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) and search for a low dimensional subspace that spans multiple target vectors in a fair manner. FPCA is defined as a non-concave maximization of the worst projected target norm within a given set. The problem arises in filter design in signal processing, and when incorporating fairness into dimensionality reduction schemes. The state of the art approach to FPCA is via semidefinite relaxation and involves a polynomial yet computationally expensive optimization. To allow scalability, we propose to address FPCA using naive sub-gradient descent. We analyze the landscape of the underlying optimization in the case of orthogonal targets. We prove that the landscape is benign and that all local minima are globally optimal. Interestingly, the SDR approach leads to sub-optimal solutions in this simple case. Finally, we discuss the equivalence between orthogonal FPCA and the design of normalized tight frames. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06557">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 54	Learning Not to Learn in the Presence of Noisy Labels</h3><h4>Liu Ziyin, Blair Chen, Ru Wang, Paul Pu Liang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Louis-Philippe Morency, Masahito Ueda</h4> Abstract: Learning in the presence of label noise is a challenging yet important task: it is crucial to design models that are robust in the presence of mislabeled datasets. In this paper, we discover that a new class of loss functions called the gambler's loss provides strong robustness to label noise across various levels of corruption. We show that training with this loss function encourages the model to "abstain" from learning on the data points with noisy labels, resulting in a simple and effective method to improve robustness and generalization. In addition, we propose two practical extensions of the method: 1) an analytical early stopping criterion to approximately stop training before the memorization of noisy labels, as well as 2) a heuristic for setting hyperparameters which do not require knowledge of the noise corruption rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving strong results across three image and text classification tasks as compared to existing baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06541">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 55	BinaryDuo: Reducing Gradient Mismatch in Binary Activation Network by  Coupling Binary Activations</h3><h4>Hyungjun Kim, Kyungsu Kim, Jinseok Kim, Jae-Joon Kim</h4> Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have been garnering interest thanks to their compute cost reduction and memory savings. However, BNNs suffer from performance degradation mainly due to the gradient mismatch caused by binarizing activations. Previous works tried to address the gradient mismatch problem by reducing the discrepancy between activation functions used at forward pass and its differentiable approximation used at backward pass, which is an indirect measure. In this work, we use the gradient of smoothed loss function to better estimate the gradient mismatch in quantized neural network. Analysis using the gradient mismatch estimator indicates that using higher precision for activation is more effective than modifying the differentiable approximation of activation function. Based on the observation, we propose a new training scheme for binary activation networks called BinaryDuo in which two binary activations are coupled into a ternary activation during training. Experimental results show that BinaryDuo outperforms state-of-the-art BNNs on various benchmarks with the same amount of parameters and computing cost. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06517">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 56	Multi-Class Classification from Noisy-Similarity-Labeled Data</h3><h4>Songhua Wu, Xiaobo Xia, Tongliang Liu, Bo Han, Mingming Gong, Nannan Wang, Haifeng Liu, Gang Niu</h4> Abstract: A similarity label indicates whether two instances belong to the same class while a class label shows the class of the instance. Without class labels, a multi-class classifier could be learned from similarity-labeled pairwise data by meta classification learning. However, since the similarity label is less informative than the class label, it is more likely to be noisy. Deep neural networks can easily remember noisy data, leading to overfitting in classification. In this paper, we propose a method for learning from only noisy-similarity-labeled data. Specifically, to model the noise, we employ a noise transition matrix to bridge the class-posterior probability between clean and noisy data. We further estimate the transition matrix from only noisy data and build a novel learning system to learn a classifier which can assign noise-free class labels for instances. Moreover, we theoretically justify how our proposed method generalizes for learning classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art method on benchmark-simulated and real-world noisy-label datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06508">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 57	First Order Optimization in Policy Space for Constrained Deep  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Yiming Zhang, Quan Vuong, Keith W. Ross</h4> Abstract: In reinforcement learning, an agent attempts to learn high-performing behaviors through interacting with the environment, such behaviors are often quantified in the form of a reward function. However some aspects of behavior, such as ones which are deemed unsafe and are to be avoided, are best captured through constraints. We propose a novel approach called First Order Constrained Optimization in Policy Space (FOCOPS) which maximizes an agent's overall reward while ensuring the agent satisfies a set of cost constraints. Using data generated from the current policy, FOCOPS first finds the optimal update policy by solving a constrained optimization problem in the nonparameterized policy space. FOCOPS then projects the update policy back into the parametric policy space. Our approach provides a guarantee for constraint satisfaction throughout training and is first-order in nature therefore extremely simple to implement. We provide empirical evidence that our algorithm achieves better performance on a set of constrained robotics locomotive tasks compared to current state of the art approaches. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06506">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 58	A closer look at the approximation capabilities of neural networks</h3><h4>Kai Fong Ernest Chong</h4> Abstract: The universal approximation theorem, in one of its most general versions, says that if we consider only continuous activation functions $\sigma$, then a standard feedforward neural network with one hidden layer is able to approximate any continuous multivariate function $f$ to any given approximation threshold $\varepsilon$, if and only if $\sigma$ is non-polynomial. In this paper, we give a direct algebraic proof of the theorem. Furthermore we shall explicitly quantify the number of hidden units required for approximation. Specifically, if $X\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is compact, then a neural network with $n$ input units, $m$ output units, and a single hidden layer with $\binom{n+d}{d}$ hidden units (independent of $m$ and $\varepsilon$), can uniformly approximate any polynomial function $f:X \to \mathbb{R}^m$ whose total degree is at most $d$ for each of its $m$ coordinate functions. In the general case that $f$ is any continuous function, we show there exists some $N\in \mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-n})$ (independent of $m$), such that $N$ hidden units would suffice to approximate $f$. We also show that this uniform approximation property (UAP) still holds even under seemingly strong conditions imposed on the weights. We highlight several consequences: (i) For any $\delta > 0$, the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights $w$ in the last layer to satisfy $|w| < \delta$. (ii) There exists some $\lambda>0$ (depending only on $f$ and $\sigma$), such that the UAP still holds if we restrict all non-bias weights $w$ in the first layer to satisfy $|w|>\lambda$. (iii) If the non-bias weights in the first layer are \emph{fixed} and randomly chosen from a suitable range, then the UAP holds with probability $1$. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06505">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 59	Differentiable Top-k Operator with Optimal Transport</h3><h4>Yujia Xie, Hanjun Dai, Minshuo Chen, Bo Dai, Tuo Zhao, Hongyuan Zha, Wei Wei, Tomas Pfister</h4> Abstract: The top-k operation, i.e., finding the k largest or smallest elements from a collection of scores, is an important model component, which is widely used in information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining. However, if the top-k operation is implemented in an algorithmic way, e.g., using bubble algorithm, the resulting model cannot be trained in an end-to-end way using prevalent gradient descent algorithms. This is because these implementations typically involve swapping indices, whose gradient cannot be computed. Moreover, the corresponding mapping from the input scores to the indicator vector of whether this element belongs to the top-k set is essentially discontinuous. To address the issue, we propose a smoothed approximation, namely the SOFT (Scalable Optimal transport-based diFferenTiable) top-k operator. Specifically, our SOFT top-k operator approximates the output of the top-k operation as the solution of an Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem. The gradient of the SOFT operator can then be efficiently approximated based on the optimality conditions of EOT problem. We apply the proposed operator to the k-nearest neighbors and beam search algorithms, and demonstrate improved performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06504">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 60	Learning Adaptive Loss for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels</h3><h4>Jun Shu, Qian Zhao, Keyu Chen, Zongben Xu, Deyu Meng</h4> Abstract: Robust loss minimization is an important strategy for handling robust learning issue on noisy labels. Current robust loss functions, however, inevitably involve hyperparameter(s) to be tuned, manually or heuristically through cross validation, which makes them fairly hard to be generally applied in practice. Besides, the non-convexity brought by the loss as well as the complicated network architecture makes it easily trapped into an unexpected solution with poor generalization capability. To address above issues, we propose a meta-learning method capable of adaptively learning hyperparameter in robust loss functions. Specifically, through mutual amelioration between robust loss hyperparameter and network parameters in our method, both of them can be simultaneously finely learned and coordinated to attain solutions with good generalization capability. Four kinds of SOTA robust loss functions are attempted to be integrated into our algorithm, and comprehensive experiments substantiate the general availability and effectiveness of the proposed method in both its accuracy and generalization performance, as compared with conventional hyperparameter tuning strategy, even with carefully tuned hyperparameters. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06482">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 61	Correlated Adversarial Imitation Learning</h3><h4>Ari Azarafrooz</h4> Abstract: A novel imitation learning algorithm is introduced by applying a game-theoretic notion of correlated equilibrium to the generative adversarial imitation learning. This imitation learning algorithm is equipped with queues of discriminators and agents, in contrast with the classical approach, where there are single discriminator and single agent. The achievement of a correlated equilibrium is due to a mediating neural architecture, which augments the observations that are being seen by queues of discriminators and agents. At every step of the training, the mediator network computes feedback using the rewards of discriminators and agents, to augment the next observations accordingly. By interacting in the game, it steers the training dynamic towards more suitable regions. The resulting imitation learning provides three important benefits. First, it makes adaptability and transferability of the learned model to new environments straightforward. Second, it is suitable for imitating a mixture of state-action trajectories. Third, it avoids the difficulties of non-convex optimization faced by the discriminator in the generative adversarial type architectures. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06476">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 62	Universal Value Density Estimation for Imitation Learning and  Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Yannick Schroecker, Charles Isbell</h4> Abstract: This work considers two distinct settings: imitation learning and goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. In either case, effective solutions require the agent to reliably reach a specified state (a goal), or set of states (a demonstration). Drawing a connection between probabilistic long-term dynamics and the desired value function, this work introduces an approach which utilizes recent advances in density estimation to effectively learn to reach a given state. As our first contribution, we use this approach for goal-conditioned reinforcement learning and show that it is both efficient and does not suffer from hindsight bias in stochastic domains. As our second contribution, we extend the approach to imitation learning and show that it achieves state-of-the art demonstration sample-efficiency on standard benchmark tasks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06473">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 63	On Coresets for Support Vector Machines</h3><h4>Murad Tukan, Cenk Baykal, Dan Feldman, Daniela Rus</h4> Abstract: We present an efficient coreset construction algorithm for large-scale Support Vector Machine (SVM) training in Big Data and streaming applications. A coreset is a small, representative subset of the original data points such that a models trained on the coreset are provably competitive with those trained on the original data set. Since the size of the coreset is generally much smaller than the original set, our preprocess-then-train scheme has potential to lead to significant speedups when training SVM models. We prove lower and upper bounds on the size of the coreset required to obtain small data summaries for the SVM problem. As a corollary, we show that our algorithm can be used to extend the applicability of any off-the-shelf SVM solver to streaming, distributed, and dynamic data settings. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real-world and synthetic data sets. Our experimental results reaffirm the favorable theoretical properties of our algorithm and demonstrate its practical effectiveness in accelerating SVM training. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06469">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 64	Federated Learning with Matched Averaging</h3><h4>Hongyi Wang, Mikhail Yurochkin, Yuekai Sun, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Yasaman Khazaeni</h4> Abstract: Federated learning allows edge devices to collaboratively learn a shared model while keeping the training data on device, decoupling the ability to do model training from the need to store the data in the cloud. We propose Federated matched averaging (FedMA) algorithm designed for federated learning of modern neural network architectures e.g. convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and LSTMs. FedMA constructs the shared global model in a layer-wise manner by matching and averaging hidden elements (i.e. channels for convolution layers; hidden states for LSTM; neurons for fully connected layers) with similar feature extraction signatures. Our experiments indicate that FedMA not only outperforms popular state-of-the-art federated learning algorithms on deep CNN and LSTM architectures trained on real world datasets, but also reduces the overall communication burden. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06440">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 65	MRRC: Multiple Role Representation Crossover Interpretation for Image  Captioning With R-CNN Feature Distribution Composition (FDC)</h3><h4>Chiranjib Sur</h4> Abstract: While image captioning through machines requires structured learning and basis for interpretation, improvement requires multiple context understanding and processing in a meaningful way. This research will provide a novel concept for context combination and will impact many applications to deal visual features as an equivalence of descriptions of objects, activities and events. There are three components of our architecture: Feature Distribution Composition (FDC) Layer Attention, Multiple Role Representation Crossover (MRRC) Attention Layer and the Language Decoder. FDC Layer Attention helps in generating the weighted attention from RCNN features, MRRC Attention Layer acts as intermediate representation processing and helps in generating the next word attention, while Language Decoder helps in estimation of the likelihood for the next probable word in the sentence. We demonstrated effectiveness of FDC, MRRC, regional object feature attention and reinforcement learning for effective learning to generate better captions from images. The performance of our model enhanced previous performances by 35.3\% and created a new standard and theory for representation generation based on logic, better interpretability and contexts. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06436">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 66	Quantum Bandits</h3><h4>Balthazar Casal√©, Giuseppe Di Molfetta, Hachem Kadri, Liva Ralaivola</h4> Abstract: We consider the quantum version of the bandit problem known as {\em best arm identification} (BAI). We first propose a quantum modeling of the BAI problem, which assumes that both the learning agent and the environment are quantum; we then propose an algorithm based on quantum amplitude amplification to solve BAI. We formally analyze the behavior of the algorithm on all instances of the problem and we show, in particular, that it is able to get the optimal solution quadratically faster than what is known to hold in the classical case. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06395">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 68	Neural Architecture Search over Decentralized Data</h3><h4>Mengwei Xu, Yuxin Zhao, Kaigui Bian, Gang Huang, Qiaozhu Mei, Xuanzhe Liu</h4> Abstract: To preserve user privacy while enabling mobile intelligence, techniques have been proposed to train deep neural networks on decentralized data. However, training over decentralized data makes the design of neural architecture quite difficult as it already was. Such difficulty is further amplified when designing and deploying different neural architectures for heterogeneous mobile platforms. In this work, we propose an automatic neural architecture search into the decentralized training, as a new DNN training paradigm called Federated Neural Architecture Search, namely federated NAS. To deal with the primary challenge of limited on-client computational and communication resources, we present FedNAS, a highly optimized framework for efficient federated NAS. FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model candidate re-training during the architecture search process, and incorporates three key optimizations: parallel candidates training on partial clients, early dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers. Tested on large-scale datasets and typical CNN architectures, FedNAS achieves comparable model accuracy as state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to two orders of magnitude compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06352">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 69	Hold me tight! Influence of discriminative features on deep network  boundaries</h3><h4>Guillermo Ortiz-Jimenez, Apostolos Modas, Seyed-Mohsen Moosavi-Dezfooli, Pascal Frossard</h4> Abstract: Important insights towards the explainability of neural networks and their properties reside in the formation of their decision boundaries. In this work, we borrow tools from the field of adversarial robustness and propose a new framework that permits to relate the features of the dataset with the distance of data samples to the decision boundary along specific directions. We demonstrate that the inductive bias of deep learning has the tendency to generate classification functions that are invariant along non-discriminative directions of the dataset. More surprisingly, we further show that training on small perturbations of the data samples are sufficient to completely change the decision boundary. This is actually the characteristic exploited by the so-called adversarial training to produce robust classifiers. Our general framework can be used to reveal the effect of specific dataset features on the macroscopic properties of deep models and to develop a better understanding of the successes and limitations of deep learning. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06349">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 70	Manifold-based Test Generation for Image Classifiers</h3><h4>Taejoon Byun, Abhishek Vijayakumar, Sanjai Rayadurgam, Darren Cofer</h4> Abstract: Neural networks used for image classification tasks in critical applications must be tested with sufficient realistic data to assure their correctness. To effectively test an image classification neural network, one must obtain realistic test data adequate enough to inspire confidence that differences between the implicit requirements and the learned model would be exposed. This raises two challenges: first, an adequate subset of the data points must be carefully chosen to inspire confidence, and second, the implicit requirements must be meaningfully extrapolated to data points beyond those in the explicit training set. This paper proposes a novel framework to address these challenges. Our approach is based on the premise that patterns in a large input data space can be effectively captured in a smaller manifold space, from which similar yet novel test cases---both the input and the label---can be sampled and generated. A variant of Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is used for capturing this manifold with a generative function, and a search technique is applied on this manifold space to efficiently find fault-revealing inputs. Experiments show that this approach enables generation of thousands of realistic yet fault-revealing test cases efficiently even for well-trained models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06337">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 71	Latent Variable Modelling with Hyperbolic Normalizing Flows</h3><h4>Avishek Joey Bose, Ariella Smofsky, Renjie Liao, Prakash Panangaden, William L. Hamilton</h4> Abstract: The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows \cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling ($\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling ($\mathcal{W}\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06336">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 72	Jelly Bean World: A Testbed for Never-Ending Learning</h3><h4>Emmanouil Antonios Platanios, Abulhair Saparov, Tom Mitchell</h4> Abstract: Machine learning has shown growing success in recent years. However, current machine learning systems are highly specialized, trained for particular problems or domains, and typically on a single narrow dataset. Human learning, on the other hand, is highly general and adaptable. Never-ending learning is a machine learning paradigm that aims to bridge this gap, with the goal of encouraging researchers to design machine learning systems that can learn to perform a wider variety of inter-related tasks in more complex environments. To date, there is no environment or testbed to facilitate the development and evaluation of never-ending learning systems. To this end, we propose the Jelly Bean World testbed. The Jelly Bean World allows experimentation over two-dimensional grid worlds which are filled with items and in which agents can navigate. This testbed provides environments that are sufficiently complex and where more generally intelligent algorithms ought to perform better than current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning approaches. It does so by producing non-stationary environments and facilitating experimentation with multi-task, multi-agent, multi-modal, and curriculum learning settings. We hope that this new freely-available software will prompt new research and interest in the development and evaluation of never-ending learning systems and more broadly, general intelligence systems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06306">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 73	Loop estimator for discounted values in Markov reward processes</h3><h4>Falcon Z. Dai, Matthew R. Walter</h4> Abstract: At the working heart of policy iteration algorithms commonly used and studied in the discounted setting of reinforcement learning, the policy evaluation step estimates the value of state with samples from a Markov reward process induced by following a Markov policy in a Markov decision process. We propose a simple and efficient estimator called \emph{loop estimator} that exploits the regenerative structure of Markov reward processes without explicitly estimating a full model. Our method enjoys a space complexity of $O(1)$ when estimating the value of a single positive recurrent state $s$ unlike TD (with $O(S)$) or model-based methods (with $O(S^2)$). Moreover, the regenerative structure enables us to show, without relying on the generative model approach, that the estimator has an instance-dependent convergence rate of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{\tau_s/T})$ over steps $T$ on a single sample path, where $\tau_s$ is the maximal expected hitting time to state $s$. In preliminary numerical experiments, the loop estimator outperforms model-free methods, such as TD(k), and is competitive with the model-based estimator. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06299">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 74	Let Me At Least Learn What You Really Like: Dealing With Noisy Humans  When Learning Preferences</h3><h4>Sriram Gopalakrishnan, Utkarsh Soni</h4> Abstract: Learning the preferences of a human improves the quality of the interaction with the human. The number of queries available to learn preferences maybe limited especially when interacting with a human, and so active learning is a must. One approach to active learning is to use uncertainty sampling to decide the informativeness of a query. In this paper, we propose a modification to uncertainty sampling which uses the expected output value to help speed up learning of preferences. We compare our approach with the uncertainty sampling baseline, as well as conduct an ablation study to test the validity of each component of our approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06288">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 75	Non-asymptotic Convergence of Adam-type Reinforcement Learning  Algorithms under Markovian Sampling</h3><h4>Huaqing Xiong, Tengyu Xu, Yingbin Liang, Wei Zhang</h4> Abstract: Despite the wide applications of Adam in reinforcement learning (RL), the theoretical convergence of Adam-type RL algorithms has not been established. This paper provides the first such convergence analysis for two fundamental RL algorithms of policy gradient (PG) and temporal difference (TD) learning that incorporate AMSGrad updates (a standard alternative of Adam in theoretical analysis), referred to as PG-AMSGrad and TD-AMSGrad, respectively. Moreover, our analysis focuses on Markovian sampling for both algorithms. We show that under general nonlinear function approximation, PG-AMSGrad with a constant stepsize converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point at the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$ (where $T$ denotes the number of iterations), and with a diminishing stepsize converges exactly to a stationary point at the rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T/\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, under linear function approximation, TD-AMSGrad with a constant stepsize converges to a neighborhood of the global optimum at the rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$, and with a diminishing stepsize converges exactly to the global optimum at the rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log T/\sqrt{T})$. Our study develops new techniques for analyzing the Adam-type RL algorithms under Markovian sampling. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06286">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 76	Algorithmic Recourse: from Counterfactual Explanations to Interventions</h3><h4>Amir-Hossein Karimi, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, Isabel Valera</h4> Abstract: As machine learning is increasingly used to inform consequential decision-making (e.g., pre-trial bail and loan approval), it becomes important to explain how the system arrived at its decision, and also suggest actions to achieve a favorable decision. Counterfactual explanations -- "how the world would have (had) to be different for a desirable outcome to occur" -- aim to satisfy these criteria. Existing works have primarily focused on designing algorithms to obtain counterfactual explanations for a wide range of settings. However, one of the main objectives of "explanations as a means to help a data-subject act rather than merely understand" has been overlooked. In layman's terms, counterfactual explanations inform an individual where they need to get to, but not how to get there. In this work, we rely on causal reasoning to caution against the use of counterfactual explanations as a recommendable set of actions for recourse. Instead, we propose a shift of paradigm from recourse via nearest counterfactual explanations to recourse through minimal interventions, moving the focus from explanations to recommendations. Finally, we provide the reader with an extensive discussion on how to realistically achieve recourse beyond structural interventions. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06278">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 77	A mean-field analysis of two-player zero-sum games</h3><h4>Carles Domingo-Enrich, Samy Jelassi, Arthur Mensch, Grant Rotskoff, Joan Bruna</h4> Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum continuous games is a central problem in machine learning, e.g. for training both GANs and robust models. The existence of pure Nash equilibria requires strong conditions which are not typically met in practice. Mixed Nash equilibria exist in greater generality and may be found using mirror descent. Yet this approach does not scale to high dimensions. To address this limitation, we parametrize mixed strategies as mixtures of particles, whose positions and weights are updated using gradient descent-ascent. We study this dynamics as an interacting gradient flow over measure spaces endowed with the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric. We establish global convergence to an approximate equilibrium for the related Langevin gradient-ascent dynamic. We prove a law of large numbers that relates particle dynamics to mean-field dynamics. Our method identifies mixed equilibria in high dimensions and is demonstrably effective for training mixtures of GANs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06277">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 78	Why Do Deep Residual Networks Generalize Better than Deep Feedforward  Networks? -- A Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective</h3><h4>Kaixuan Huang, Yuqing Wang, Molei Tao, Tuo Zhao</h4> Abstract: Deep residual networks (ResNets) have demonstrated better generalization performance than deep feedforward networks (FFNets). However, the theory behind such a phenomenon is still largely unknown. This paper studies this fundamental problem in deep learning from a so-called "neural tangent kernel" perspective. Specifically, we first show that under proper conditions, as the width goes to infinity, training deep ResNets can be viewed as learning reproducing kernel functions with some kernel function. We then compare the kernel of deep ResNets with that of deep FFNets and discover that the class of functions induced by the kernel of FFNets is asymptotically not learnable, as the depth goes to infinity. In contrast, the class of functions induced by the kernel of ResNets does not exhibit such degeneracy. Our discovery partially justifies the advantages of deep ResNets over deep FFNets in generalization abilities. Numerical results are provided to support our claim. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06262">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 79	Mapping Motor Cortex Stimulation to Muscle Responses: A Deep Neural  Network Modeling Approach</h3><h4>Md Navid Akbar, Mathew Yarossi, Marc Martinez-Gost, Marc A. Sommer, Moritz Dannhauer, Sumientra Rampersad, Dana Brooks, Eugene Tunik, Deniz Erdoƒümu≈ü</h4> Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) that can reliably model muscle responses from corresponding brain stimulation has the potential to increase knowledge of coordinated motor control for numerous basic science and applied use cases. Such cases include the understanding of abnormal movement patterns due to neurological injury from stroke, and stimulation based interventions for neurological recovery such as paired associative stimulation. In this work, potential DNN models are explored and the one with the minimum squared errors is recommended for the optimal performance of the M2M-Net, a network that maps transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to corresponding muscle responses, using: a finite element simulation, an empirical neural response profile, a convolutional autoencoder, a separate deep network mapper, and recordings of multi-muscle activation. We discuss the rationale behind the different modeling approaches and architectures, and contrast their results. Additionally, to obtain a comparative insight of the trade-off between complexity and performance analysis, we explore different techniques, including the extension of two classical information criteria for M2M-Net. Finally, we find that the model analogous to mapping the motor cortex stimulation to a combination of direct and synergistic connection to the muscles performs the best, when the neural response profile is used at the input. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06250">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 80	Robust Policies For Proactive ICU Transfers</h3><h4>Julien Grand-Clement, Carri W. Chan, Vineet Goyal, Gabriel Escobar</h4> Abstract: Patients whose transfer to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is unplanned are prone to higher mortality rates than those who were admitted directly to the ICU. Recent advances in machine learning to predict patient deterioration have introduced the possibility of \emph{proactive transfer} from the ward to the ICU. In this work, we study the problem of finding \emph{robust} patient transfer policies which account for uncertainty in statistical estimates due to data limitations when optimizing to improve overall patient care. We propose a Markov Decision Process model to capture the evolution of patient health, where the states represent a measure of patient severity. Under fairly general assumptions, we show that an optimal transfer policy has a threshold structure, i.e., that it transfers all patients above a certain severity level to the ICU (subject to available capacity). As model parameters are typically determined based on statistical estimations from real-world data, they are inherently subject to misspecification and estimation errors. We account for this parameter uncertainty by deriving a robust policy that optimizes the worst-case reward across all plausible values of the model parameters. We show that the robust policy also has a threshold structure under fairly general assumptions. Moreover, it is more aggressive in transferring patients than the optimal nominal policy, which does not take into account parameter uncertainty. We present computational experiments using a dataset of hospitalizations at 21 KNPC hospitals, and present empirical evidence of the sensitivity of various hospital metrics (mortality, length-of-stay, average ICU occupancy) to small changes in the parameters. Our work provides useful insights into the impact of parameter uncertainty on deriving simple policies for proactive ICU transfer that have strong empirical performance and theoretical guarantees. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06247">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 81	On State Variables, Bandit Problems and POMDPs</h3><h4>Warren B Powell</h4> Abstract: State variables are easily the most subtle dimension of sequential decision problems. This is especially true in the context of active learning problems (bandit problems") where decisions affect what we observe and learn. We describe our canonical framework that models {\it any} sequential decision problem, and present our definition of state variables that allows us to claim: Any properly modeled sequential decision problem is Markovian. We then present a novel two-agent perspective of partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs) that allows us to then claim: Any model of a real decision problem is (possibly) non-Markovian. We illustrate these perspectives using the context of observing and treating flu in a population, and provide examples of all four classes of policies in this setting. We close with an indication of how to extend this thinking to multiagent problems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06238">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 82	Wind speed prediction using a hybrid model of the multi-layer perceptron  and whale optimization algorithm</h3><h4>Saeed Samadianfard, Sajjad Hashemi, Katayoun Kargar, Mojtaba Izadyar, Ali Mostafaeipour, Amir Mosavi, Narjes Nabipour, Shahaboddin Shamshirband</h4> Abstract: Wind power as a renewable source of energy, has numerous economic, environmental and social benefits. In order to enhance and control renewable wind power, it is vital to utilize models that predict wind speed with high accuracy. Due to neglecting of requirement and significance of data preprocessing and disregarding the inadequacy of using a single predicting model, many traditional models have poor performance in wind speed prediction. In the current study, for predicting wind speed at target stations in the north of Iran, the combination of a multi-layer perceptron model (MLP) with the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) used to build new method (MLP-WOA) with a limited set of data (2004-2014). Then, the MLP-WOA model was utilized at each of the ten target stations, with the nine stations for training and tenth station for testing (namely: Astara, Bandar-E-Anzali, Rasht, Manjil, Jirandeh, Talesh, Kiyashahr, Lahijan, Masuleh, and Deylaman) to increase the accuracy of the subsequent hybrid model. The capability of the hybrid model in wind speed forecasting at each target station was compared with the MLP model without the WOA optimizer. To determine definite results, numerous statistical performances were utilized. For all ten target stations, the MLP-WOA model had precise outcomes than the standalone MLP model. The hybrid model had acceptable performances with lower amounts of the RMSE, SI and RE parameters and higher values of NSE, WI, and KGE parameters. It was concluded that the WOA optimization algorithm can improve the prediction accuracy of MLP model and may be recommended for accurate wind speed prediction. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06226">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 84	Resource Management in Wireless Networks via Multi-Agent Deep  Reinforcement Learning</h3><h4>Navid Naderializadeh, Jaroslaw Sydir, Meryem Simsek, Hosein Nikopour</h4> Abstract: We propose a mechanism for distributed radio resource management using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL) for interference mitigation in wireless networks. We equip each transmitter in the network with a deep RL agent, which receives partial delayed observations from its associated users, while also exchanging observations with its neighboring agents, and decides on which user to serve and what transmit power to use at each scheduling interval. Our proposed framework enables the agents to make decisions simultaneously and in a distributed manner, without any knowledge about the concurrent decisions of other agents. Moreover, our design of the agents' observation and action spaces is scalable, in the sense that an agent trained on a scenario with a specific number of transmitters and receivers can be readily applied to scenarios with different numbers of transmitters and/or receivers. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to decentralized baselines in terms of the tradeoff between average and $5^{th}$ percentile user rates, while achieving performance close to, and even in certain cases outperforming, that of a centralized information-theoretic scheduling algorithm. We also show that our trained agents are robust and maintain their performance gains when experiencing mismatches between training and testing deployments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06215">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 85	Fast Fair Regression via Efficient Approximations of Mutual Information</h3><h4>Daniel Steinberg, Alistair Reid, Simon O'Callaghan, Finnian Lattimore, Lachlan McCalman, Tiberio Caetano</h4> Abstract: Most work in algorithmic fairness to date has focused on discrete outcomes, such as deciding whether to grant someone a loan or not. In these classification settings, group fairness criteria such as independence, separation and sufficiency can be measured directly by comparing rates of outcomes between subpopulations. Many important problems however require the prediction of a real-valued outcome, such as a risk score or insurance premium. In such regression settings, measuring group fairness criteria is computationally challenging, as it requires estimating information-theoretic divergences between conditional probability density functions. This paper introduces fast approximations of the independence, separation and sufficiency group fairness criteria for regression models from their (conditional) mutual information definitions, and uses such approximations as regularisers to enforce fairness within a regularised risk minimisation framework. Experiments in real-world datasets indicate that in spite of its superior computational efficiency our algorithm still displays state-of-the-art accuracy/fairness tradeoffs. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06200">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 86	Precision Gating: Improving Neural Network Efficiency with Dynamic  Dual-Precision Activations</h3><h4>Yichi Zhang, Ritchie Zhao, Weizhe Hua, Nayun Xu, G. Edward Suh, Zhiru Zhang</h4> Abstract: We propose precision gating (PG), an end-to-end trainable dynamic dual-precision quantization technique for deep neural networks. PG computes most features in a low precision and only a small proportion of important features in a higher precision to preserve accuracy. The proposed approach is applicable to a variety of DNN architectures and significantly reduces the computational cost of DNN execution with almost no accuracy loss. Our experiments indicate that PG achieves excellent results on CNNs, including statically compressed mobile-friendly networks such as ShuffleNet. Compared to the state-of-the-art prediction-based quantization schemes, PG achieves the same or higher accuracy with 2.4$\times$ less compute on ImageNet. PG furthermore applies to RNNs. Compared to 8-bit uniform quantization, PG obtains a 1.2% improvement in perplexity per word with 2.7$\times$ computational cost reduction on LSTM on the Penn Tree Bank dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07136">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 87	Disease State Prediction From Single-Cell Data Using Graph Attention  Networks</h3><h4>Neal G. Ravindra, Arijit Sehanobish, Jenna L. Pappalardo, David A. Hafler, David van Dijk</h4> Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological discovery, providing an unbiased picture of cellular heterogeneity in tissues. While scRNA-seq has been used extensively to provide insight into health and disease, it has not been used for disease prediction or diagnostics. Graph Attention Networks have proven to be versatile for a wide range of tasks by learning from both original features and graph structures. Here we present a graph attention model for predicting disease state from single-cell data on a large dataset of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. MS is a disease of the central nervous system that is difficult to diagnose. We train our model on single-cell data obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for a cohort of seven MS patients and six healthy adults (HA), resulting in 66,667 individual cells. We achieve $\mathbf{92}$ \% accuracy in predicting MS, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as a graph convolutional network, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron. Further, we use the learned graph attention model to get insight into the features (cell types and genes) that are important for this prediction. The graph attention model also allow us to infer a new feature space for the cells that emphasizes the difference between the two conditions. Finally we use the attention weights to learn a new low-dimensional embedding which we visualize with PHATE and UMAP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to use graph attention, and deep learning in general, to predict disease state from single-cell data. We envision applying this method to single-cell data for other diseases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07128">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 88	4D Semantic Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis on XCAT  Anatomical Model</h3><h4>Samaneh Abbasi-Sureshjani, Sina Amirrajab, Cristian Lorenz, Juergen Weese, Josien Pluim, Marcel Breeuwer</h4> Abstract: We propose a hybrid controllable image generation method to synthesize anatomically meaningful 3D+t labeled Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) images. Our hybrid method takes the mechanistic 4D eXtended CArdiac Torso (XCAT) heart model as the anatomical ground truth and synthesizes CMR images via a data-driven Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We employ the state-of-the-art SPatially Adaptive De-normalization (SPADE) technique for conditional image synthesis to preserve the semantic spatial information of ground truth anatomy. Using the parameterized motion model of the XCAT heart, we generate labels for 25 time frames of the heart for one cardiac cycle at 18 locations for the short axis view. Subsequently, realistic images are generated from these labels, with modality-specific features that are learned from real CMR image data. We demonstrate that style transfer from another cardiac image can be accomplished by using a style encoder network. Due to the flexibility of XCAT in creating new heart models, this approach can result in a realistic virtual population to address different challenges the medical image analysis research community is facing such as expensive data collection. Our proposed method has a great potential to synthesize 4D controllable CMR images with annotations and adaptable styles to be used in various supervised multi-site, multi-vendor applications in medical image analysis. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07089">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 89	Query-Efficient Physical Hard-Label Attacks on Deep Learning Visual  Classification</h3><h4>Ryan Feng, Jiefeng Chen, Nelson Manohar, Earlence Fernandes, Somesh Jha, Atul Prakash</h4> Abstract: We present Survival-OPT, a physical adversarial example algorithm in the black-box hard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the model prediction class label. Assuming such limited access to the model is more relevant for settings such as proprietary cyber-physical and cloud systems than the whitebox setting assumed by prior work. By leveraging the properties of physical attacks, we create a novel approach based on the survivability of perturbations corresponding to physical transformations. Through simply querying the model for hard-label predictions, we optimize perturbations to survive in many different physical conditions and show that adversarial examples remain a security risk to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) even in the hard-label threat model. We show that Survival-OPT is query-efficient and robust: using fewer than 200K queries, we successfully attack a stop sign to be misclassified as a speed limit 30 km/hr sign in 98.5% of video frames in a drive-by setting. Survival-OPT also outperforms our baseline combination of existing hard-label and physical approaches, which required over 10x more queries for less robust results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07088">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 90	PCSGAN: Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks  for Thermal and NIR to Visible Image Transformation</h3><h4>Kancharagunta Kishan Babu, Shiv Ram Dubey</h4> Abstract: In many real world scenarios, it is difficult to capture the images in the visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal (THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding. However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise losses (like L1 or L2) as the objective function for training. The quality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still not up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective functions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the transformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is introduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the perceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the adversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to judge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR scene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in terms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures.

<h3>No. 91	Scalable Dyadic Independence Models with Local and Global Constraints</h3><h4>Florian Adriaens, Alexandru Mara, Jefrey Lijffijt, Tijl De Bie</h4> Abstract: An important challenge in the field of exponential random graphs (ERGs) is the fitting of non-trivial ERGs on large networks. By utilizing matrix block-approximation techniques, we propose an approximative framework to such non-trivial ERGs that result in dyadic independence (i.e., edge independent) models, while being able to meaningfully model local information (degrees) as well as global information (clustering coefficient, assortativity, etc.) if desired. This allows one to efficiently generate random networks with similar properties as an observed network, scalable up to sparse graphs consisting of millions of nodes. Empirical evaluation demonstrates its competitiveness in terms of accuracy with state-of-the-art methods for link prediction and network reconstruction. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07076">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 92	Acoustic Scene Classification Using Bilinear Pooling on Time-liked and  Frequency-liked Convolution Neural Network</h3><h4>Xing Yong Kek, Cheng Siong Chin, Ye Li</h4> Abstract: The current methodology in tackling Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) task can be described in two steps, preprocessing of the audio waveform into log-mel spectrogram and then using it as the input representation for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This paradigm shift occurs after DCASE 2016 where this framework model achieves the state-of-the-art result in ASC tasks on the (ESC-50) dataset and achieved an accuracy of 64.5%, which constitute to 20.5% improvement over the baseline model, and DCASE 2016 dataset with an accuracy of 90.0% (development) and 86.2% (evaluation), which constitute a 6.4% and 9% improvements with respect to the baseline system. In this paper, we explored the use of harmonic and percussive source separation (HPSS) to split the audio into harmonic audio and percussive audio, which has received popularity in the field of music information retrieval (MIR). Although works have been done in using HPSS as input representation for CNN model in ASC task, this paper further investigate the possibility on leveraging the separated harmonic component and percussive component by curating 2 CNNs which tries to understand harmonic audio and percussive audio in their natural form, one specialized in extracting deep features in time biased domain and another specialized in extracting deep features in frequency biased domain, respectively. The deep features extracted from these 2 CNNs will then be combined using bilinear pooling. Hence, presenting a two-stream time and frequency CNN architecture approach in classifying acoustic scene. The model is being evaluated on DCASE 2019 sub task 1a dataset and scored an average of 65% on development dataset, Kaggle Leadership Private and Public board. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07065">PDF</a>

Preliminary results on breast cancer data show significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, such as the prioritization of genes that are not identified as potential candidates by interactome-based algorithms, but that appear to be involved in/or potentially related to breast cancer, according to a functional analysis based on recent literature. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07064">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 94	An optimal scheduling architecture for accelerating batch algorithms on  Neural Network processor architectures</h3><h4>Phani Kumar Nyshadham, Mohit Sinha, Biswajit Mishra, H S Vijay</h4> Abstract: In neural network topologies, algorithms are running on batches of data tensors. The batches of data are typically scheduled onto the computing cores which execute in parallel. For the algorithms running on batches of data, an optimal batch scheduling architecture is very much needed by suitably utilizing hardware resources - thereby resulting in significant reduction training and inference time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the batch algorithms for neural networks through a scheduling architecture enabling optimal compute power utilization. The proposed optimal scheduling architecture can be built into HW or can be implemented in SW alone which can be leveraged for accelerating batch algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture speeds up the batch algorithms compared to the previous solutions. The proposed idea applies to any HPC architecture meant for neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07062">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 95	Learning to Prove Theorems by Learning to Generate Theorems</h3><h4>Mingzhe Wang, Jia Deng</h4> Abstract: We consider the task of automated theorem proving, a key AI task. Deep learning has shown promise for training theorem provers, but there are limited human-written theorems and proofs available for supervised learning. To address this limitation, we propose to learn a neural generator that automatically synthesizes theorems and proofs for the purpose of training a theorem prover. Experiments on real-world tasks demonstrate that synthetic data from our approach improves the theorem prover and advances the state of the art of automated theorem proving in Metamath. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07019">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 96	Meta-learning Extractors for Music Source Separation</h3><h4>David Samuel, Aditya Ganeshan, Jason Naradowsky</h4> Abstract: We propose a hierarchical meta-learning-inspired model for music source separation (Meta-TasNet) in which a generator model is used to predict the weights of individual extractor models. This enables efficient parameter-sharing, while still allowing for instrument-specific parameterization. Meta-TasNet is shown to be more effective than the models trained independently or in a multi-task setting, and achieve performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods. In comparison to the latter, our extractors contain fewer parameters and have faster run-time performance. We discuss important architectural considerations, and explore the costs and benefits of this approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07016">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 97	The Synthesizability of Molecules Proposed by Generative Models</h3><h4>Wenhao Gao, Connor W. Coley</h4> Abstract: The discovery of functional molecules is an expensive and time-consuming process, exemplified by the rising costs of small molecule therapeutic discovery. One class of techniques of growing interest for early-stage drug discovery is de novo molecular generation and optimization, catalyzed by the development of new deep learning approaches. These techniques can suggest novel molecular structures intended to maximize a multi-objective function, e.g., suitability as a therapeutic against a particular target, without relying on brute-force exploration of a chemical space. However, the utility of these approaches is stymied by ignorance of synthesizability. To highlight the severity of this issue, we use a data-driven computer-aided synthesis planning program to quantify how often molecules proposed by state-of-the-art generative models cannot be readily synthesized. Our analysis demonstrates that there are several tasks for which these models generate unrealistic molecular structures despite performing well on popular quantitative benchmarks. Synthetic complexity heuristics can successfully bias generation toward synthetically-tractable chemical space, although doing so necessarily detracts from the primary objective. This analysis suggests that to improve the utility of these models in real discovery workflows, new algorithm development is warranted. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07007">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 98	A Newton Frank-Wolfe Method for Constrained Self-Concordant Minimization</h3><h4>Deyi Liu, Volkan Cevher, Quoc Tran-Dinh</h4> Abstract: We demonstrate how to scalably solve a class of constrained self-concordant minimization problems using linear minimization oracles (LMO) over the constraint set. We prove that the number of LMO calls of our method is nearly the same as that of the Frank-Wolfe method in the L-smooth case. Specifically, our Newton Frank-Wolfe method uses $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\nu})$ LMO's, where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy and $\nu:= 1 + o(1)$. In addition, we demonstrate how our algorithm can exploit the improved variants of the LMO-based schemes, including away-steps, to attain linear convergence rates. We also provide numerical evidence with portfolio design with the competitive ratio, D-optimal experimental design, and logistic regression with the elastic net where Newton Frank-Wolfe outperforms the state-of-the-art. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07003">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 99	Learning Architectures for Binary Networks</h3><h4>Kunal Pratap Singh, Dahyun Kim, Jonghyun Choi</h4> Abstract: Backbone architectures of most binary networks are well-known floating point architectures, such as the ResNet family. Questioning that the architectures designed for floating-point networks would not be the best for binary networks, we propose to search architectures for binary networks (BNAS). Specifically, based on the cell based search method, we define a new set of layer types, design a new cell template, and rediscover the utility of and propose to use the Zeroise layer to learn well-performing binary networks. In addition, we propose to diversify early search to learn better performing binary architectures. We show that our searched binary networks outperform state-of-the-art binary networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06963">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 100	Citation Recommendation: Approaches and Datasets</h3><h4>Michael F√§rber, Adam Jatowt</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation describes the task of recommending citations for a given text. Due to the overload of published scientific works in recent years on the one hand, and the need to cite the most appropriate publications when writing scientific texts on the other hand, citation recommendation has emerged as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and evaluation data sets have been presented. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature survey has been conducted explicitly on citation recommendation. In this article, we give a thorough introduction into automatic citation recommendation research. We then present an overview of the approaches and data sets for citation recommendation and identify differences and commonalities using various dimensions. Last but not least, we shed light on the evaluation methods, and outline general challenges in the evaluation and how to meet them. We restrict ourselves to citation recommendation for scientific publications, as this document type has been studied the most in this area. However, many of the observations and discussions included in this survey are also applicable to other types of text, such as news articles and encyclopedic articles. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06961">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 101	Adaptive Experience Selection for Policy Gradient</h3><h4>Saad Mohamad, Giovanni Montana</h4> Abstract: Policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have achieved impressive performance in challenging learning tasks such as continuous control, but suffer from high sample complexity. Experience replay is a commonly used approach to improve sample efficiency, but gradient estimators using past trajectories typically have high variance. Existing sampling strategies for experience replay like uniform sampling or prioritised experience replay do not explicitly try to control the variance of the gradient estimates. In this paper, we propose an online learning algorithm, adaptive experience selection (AES), to adaptively learn an experience sampling distribution that explicitly minimises this variance. Using a regret minimisation approach, AES iteratively updates the experience sampling distribution to match the performance of a competitor distribution assumed to have optimal variance. Sample non-stationarity is addressed by proposing a dynamic (i.e. time changing) competitor distribution for which a closed-form solution is proposed. We demonstrate that AES is a low-regret algorithm with reasonable sample complexity. Empirically, AES has been implemented for deep deterministic policy gradient and soft actor critic algorithms, and tested on 8 continuous control tasks from the OpenAI Gym library. Ours results show that AES leads to significantly improved performance compared to currently available experience sampling strategies for policy gradient. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06946">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 102	Amplifying The Uncanny</h3><h4>Terence Broad, Frederic Fol Leymarie, Mick Grierson</h4> Abstract: Deep neural networks have become remarkably good at producing realistic deepfakes, images of people that are (to the untrained eye) indistinguishable from real images. These are produced by algorithms that learn to distinguish between real and fake images and are optimised to generate samples that the system deems realistic. This paper, and the resulting series of artworks Being Foiled explore the aesthetic outcome of inverting this process and instead optimising the system to generate images that it sees as being fake. Maximising the unlikelihood of the data and in turn, amplifying the uncanny nature of these machine hallucinations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06890">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 103	Large-scale biometry with interpretable neural network regression on UK  Biobank body MRI</h3><h4>Taro Langner, H√•kan Ahlstr√∂m, Joel Kullberg</h4> Abstract: The UK Biobank study has successfully imaged more than 32,000 volunteer participants with neck-to-knee body MRI. Each scan is linked to extensive metadata, providing a comprehensive survey of imaged anatomy and related health states. Despite its potential for research, this vast amount of data presents a challenge to established methods of evaluation, which often rely on manual input. To date, the range of reference values for cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is therefore incomplete. In this work, neural networks were trained for regression to infer various biological metrics from the neck-to-knee body MRI automatically. The approach requires no manual intervention or ground truth segmentations for training. The examined fields span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and dedicated liver scans. The standardized framework achieved a close fit to the target values (median R^2 > 0.97) in 7-fold cross-validation with the ResNet50. Interpretation of aggregated saliency maps suggests that the network correctly targets specific body regions and limbs, and learned to emulate different modalities. On several body composition metrics, the quality of the predictions is within the range of variability observed between established gold standard techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06862">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 104	Hierarchical Rule Induction Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning</h3><h4>Sheng Hu, Yuqing Ma, Xianglong Liu, Yanlu Wei, Shihao Bai</h4> Abstract: Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to analyze information, discover rules at an intangible level, and solve problems in innovative ways. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of abstract reasoning. In the test, the subject is asked to identify the correct choice from the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM (e.g., a 3$\times$3 matrix), following the underlying rules inside the matrix. Recent studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved encouraging progress to accomplish the RPM test problems. Unfortunately, simply relying on the relation extraction at the matrix level, they fail to recognize the complex attribute patterns inside or across rows/columns of RPM. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a Hierarchical Rule Induction Network (HriNet), by intimating human induction strategies. HriNet extracts multiple granularity rule embeddings at different levels and integrates them through a gated embedding fusion module. We further introduce a rule similarity metric based on the embeddings, so that HriNet can not only be trained using a tuplet loss but also infer the best answer according to the similarity score. To comprehensively evaluate HriNet, we first fix the defects contained in the very recent RAVEN dataset and generate a new one named Balanced-RAVEN. Then extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale dataset PGM and our Balanced-RAVEN, the results of which show that HriNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06838">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 105	Addressing the confounds of accompaniments in singer identification</h3><h4>Tsung-Han Hsieh, Kai-Hsiang Cheng, Zhe-Cheng Fan, Yu-Ching Yang, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: Identifying singers is an important task with many applications. However, the task remains challenging due to many issues. One major issue is related to the confounding factors from the background instrumental music that is mixed with the vocals in music production. A singer identification model may learn to extract non-vocal related features from the instrumental part of the songs, if a singer only sings in certain musical contexts (e.g., genres). The model cannot therefore generalize well when the singer sings in unseen contexts. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we employ open-unmix, an open source tool with state-of-the-art performance in source separation, to separate the vocal and instrumental tracks of music. We then investigate two means to train a singer identification model: by learning from the separated vocal only, or from an augmented set of data where we "shuffle-and-remix" the separated vocal tracks and instrumental tracks of different songs to artificially make the singers sing in different contexts. We also incorporate melodic features learned from the vocal melody contour for better performance. Evaluation results on a benchmark dataset called the artist20 shows that this data augmentation method greatly improves the accuracy of singer identification. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06817">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 106	On the Similarity of Deep Learning Representations Across Didactic and  Adversarial Examples</h3><h4>Pamela K. Douglas, Farzad Vasheghani Farahani</h4> Abstract: The increasing use of deep neural networks (DNNs) has motivated a parallel endeavor: the design of adversaries that profit from successful misclassifications. However, not all adversarial examples are crafted for malicious purposes. For example, real world systems often contain physical, temporal, and sampling variability across instrumentation. Adversarial examples in the wild may inadvertently prove deleterious for accurate predictive modeling. Conversely, naturally occurring covariance of image features may serve didactic purposes. Here, we studied the stability of deep learning representations for neuroimaging classification across didactic and adversarial conditions characteristic of MRI acquisition variability. We show that representational similarity and performance vary according to the frequency of adversarial examples in the input space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06816">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 108	How to 0wn NAS in Your Spare Time</h3><h4>Sanghyun Hong, Michael Davinroy, Yiƒüitcan Kaya, Dana Dachman-Soled, Tudor Dumitra≈ü</h4> Abstract: New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning systems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06776">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 109	Superpixel Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks with  Regularized Information Maximization</h3><h4>Teppei Suzuki</h4> Abstract: We propose an unsupervised superpixel segmentation method by optimizing a randomly-initialized convolutional neural network (CNN) in inference time. Our method generates superpixels via CNN from a single image without any labels by minimizing a proposed objective function for superpixel segmentation in inference time. There are three advantages to our method compared with many of existing methods: (i) leverages an image prior of CNN for superpixel segmentation, (ii) adaptively changes the number of superpixels according to the given images, and (iii) controls the property of superpixels by adding an auxiliary cost to the objective function. We verify the advantages of our method quantitatively and qualitatively on BSDS500 and SBD datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06765">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 110	(Individual) Fairness for $k$-Clustering</h3><h4>Sepideh Mahabadi, Ali Vakilian</h4> Abstract: We give a local search based algorithm for $k$-median ($k$-means) clustering from the perspective of individual fairness. More precisely, for a point $x$ in a point set $P$ of size $n$, let $r(x)$ be the minimum radius such that the ball of radius $r(x)$ centered at $x$ has at least $n/k$ points from $P$. Intuitively, if a set of $k$ random points are chosen from $P$ as centers, every point $x\in P$ expects to have a center within radius $r(x)$. An individually fair clustering provides such a guarantee for every point $x\in P$. This notion of fairness was introduced in [Jung et al., 2019] where they showed how to get an approximately feasible $k$-clustering with respect to this fairness condition. In this work, we show how to get an approximately optimal such fair $k$-clustering. The $k$-median ($k$-means) cost of our solution is within a constant factor of the cost of an optimal fair $k$-clustering, and our solution approximately satisfies the fairness condition (also within a constant factor). Further, we complement our theoretical bounds with empirical evaluation. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06742">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 111	Automatic Frame Selection using CNN in Ultrasound Elastography</h3><h4>Abdelrahman Zayed, Guy Cloutier, Hassan Rivaz</h4> Abstract: Ultrasound elastography is used to estimate the mechanical properties of the tissue by monitoring its response to an internal or external force. Different levels of deformation are obtained from different tissue types depending on their mechanical properties, where stiffer tissues deform less. Given two radio frequency (RF) frames collected before and after some deformation, we estimate displacement and strain images by comparing the RF frames. The quality of the strain image is dependent on the type of motion that occurs during deformation. In-plane axial motion results in high-quality strain images, whereas out-of-plane motion results in low-quality strain images. In this paper, we introduce a new method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to determine the suitability of a pair of RF frames for elastography in only 5.4 ms. Our method could also be used to automatically choose the best pair of RF frames, yielding a high-quality strain image. The CNN was trained on 3,818 pairs of RF frames, while testing was done on 986 new unseen pairs, achieving an accuracy of more than 91%. The RF frames were collected from both phantom and in vivo data. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06734">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 112	Stochastic Normalizing Flows</h3><h4>Hao Wu, Jonas K√∂hler, Frank No√©</h4> Abstract: Normalizing flows are popular generative learning methods that train an invertible function to transform a simple prior distribution into a complicated target distribution. Here we generalize the framework by introducing Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF) - an arbitrary sequence of deterministic invertible functions and stochastic processes such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Langevin Dynamics. This combination can be powerful as adding stochasticity to a flow helps overcoming expressiveness limitations of a chosen deterministic invertible function, while the trainable flow transformations can improve the sampling efficiency over pure MCMC. Key to our approach is that we can match a marginal target density without having to marginalize out the stochasticity of traversed paths. Invoking ideas from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, we introduce a training method that only uses conditional path probabilities. We can turn an SNF into a Boltzmann Generator that samples asymptotically unbiased from a given target density by importance sampling of these paths. We illustrate the representational power, sampling efficiency and asymptotic correctness of SNFs on several benchmarks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06707">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 113	Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) -- Exploring the Linguistic  Aspects of Visual Captioning in Indian Languages (Bengali) Using MSCOCO  Framework</h3><h4>Chiranjib Sur</h4> Abstract: In this work, we have introduced Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) for Better Semantic Selection for Indian regional language-based image captioning and introduced a procedure where we used the existing translation and English crowd-sourced sentences for training. We have shown that this architecture is a promising alternative source, where there is a crunch in resources. Our main contribution of this work is the development of deep learning architectures for the Bengali language (is the fifth widely spoken language in the world) with a completely different grammar and language attributes. We have shown that these are working well for complex applications like language generation from image contexts and can diversify the representation through introducing constraints, more extensive features, and unique feature spaces. We also established that we could achieve absolute precision and diversity when we use smoothened semantic tensor with the traditional LSTM and feature decomposition networks. With better learning architecture, we succeeded in establishing an automated algorithm and assessment procedure that can help in the evaluation of competent applications without the requirement for expertise and human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06701">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 114	Structures of Spurious Local Minima in $k$-means</h3><h4>Wei Qian, Yuqian Zhang, Yudong Chen</h4> Abstract: $k$-means clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning. The problem concerns finding a partition of the data points into $k$ clusters such that the within-cluster variation is minimized. Despite its importance and wide applicability, a theoretical understanding of the $k$-means problem has not been completely satisfactory. Existing algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees often rely on sophisticated (sometimes artificial) algorithmic techniques and restricted assumptions on the data. The main challenge lies in the non-convex nature of the problem; in particular, there exist additional local solutions other than the global optimum. Moreover, the simplest and most popular algorithm for $k$-means, namely Lloyd's algorithm, generally converges to such spurious local solutions both in theory and in practice. In this paper, we approach the $k$-means problem from a new perspective, by investigating the structures of these spurious local solutions under a probabilistic generative model with $k$ ground truth clusters. As soon as $k=3$, spurious local minima provably exist, even for well-separated and balanced clusters. One such local minimum puts two centers at one true cluster, and the third center in the middle of the other two true clusters. For general $k$, one local minimum puts multiple centers at a true cluster, and one center in the middle of multiple true clusters. Perhaps surprisingly, we prove that this is essentially the only type of spurious local minima under a separation condition. Our results pertain to the $k$-means formulation for mixtures of Gaussians or bounded distributions. Our theoretical results corroborate existing empirical observations and provide justification for several improved algorithms for $k$-means clustering. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06694">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 115	Global and Local Feature Learning for Ego-Network Analysis</h3><h4>Fatemeh Salehi Rizi, Michael Granitzer, Konstantin Ziegler</h4> Abstract: In an ego-network, an individual (ego) organizes its friends (alters) in different groups (social circles). This social network can be efficiently analyzed after learning representations of the ego and its alters in a low-dimensional, real vector space. These representations are then easily exploited via statistical models for tasks such as social circle detection and prediction. Recent advances in language modeling via deep learning have inspired new methods for learning network representations. These methods can capture the global structure of networks. In this paper, we evolve these techniques to also encode the local structure of neighborhoods. Therefore, our local representations capture network features that are hidden in the global representation of large networks. We show that the task of social circle prediction benefits from a combination of global and local features generated by our technique. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06685">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 116	Predicting event attendance exploring social influence</h3><h4>Fatemeh Salehi Rizi, Michael Granitzer</h4> Abstract: The problem of predicting people's participation in real-world events has received considerable attention as it offers valuable insights for human behavior analysis and event-related advertisement. Today social networks (e.g. Twitter) widely reflect large popular events where people discuss their interest with friends. Event participants usually stimulate friends to join the event which propagates a social influence in the network. In this paper, we propose to model the social influence of friends on event attendance. We consider non-geotagged posts besides structures of social groups to infer users' attendance. To leverage the information on network topology we apply some of recent graph embedding techniques such as node2vec, HARP and Poincar`e. We describe the approach followed to design the feature space and feed it to a neural network. The performance evaluation is conducted using two large music festivals datasets, namely the VFestival and Creamfields. The experimental results show that our classifier outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with 89% accuracy observed for the VFestival dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06665">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 117	SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word  Models</h3><h4>Bin Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo</h4> Abstract: Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models. Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06652">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 118	Coresets for the Nearest-Neighbor Rule</h3><h4>Alejandro Flores Velazco, David M. Mount</h4> Abstract: The problem of nearest-neighbor condensation deals with finding a subset R from a set of labeled points P such that for every point p in R the nearest-neighbor of p in R has the same label as p. This is motivated by applications in classification, where the nearest-neighbor rule assigns to an unlabeled query point the label of its nearest-neighbor in the point set. In this context, condensation aims to reduce the size of the set needed to classify new points. However, finding such subsets of minimum cardinality is NP-hard, and most research has focused on practical heuristics without performance guarantees. Additionally, the use of exact nearest-neighbors is always assumed, ignoring the effect of condensation in the classification accuracy when nearest-neighbors are computed approximately. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing new approximation-sensitive criteria for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem, along with practical algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We characterize sufficient conditions to guarantee correct classification of unlabeled points using approximate nearest-neighbor queries on these subsets, which introduces the notion of coresets for classification with the nearest-neighbor rule. Moreover, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute subsets with these characteristics, whose cardinality approximates that of the minimum cardinality subset. Additionally, we propose new algorithms for computing such subsets, with tight approximation factors in general metrics, and improved factors for doubling metrics and l_p metrics with p >= 2. Finally, we show an alternative implementation scheme that reduces the worst-case time complexity of one of these algorithms, becoming the first truly subquadratic approximation algorithm for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06650">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 119	Speech-to-Singing Conversion in an Encoder-Decoder Framework</h3><h4>Jayneel Parekh, Preeti Rao, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: In this paper our goal is to convert a set of spoken lines into sung ones. Unlike previous signal processing based methods, we take a learning based approach to the problem. This allows us to automatically model various aspects of this transformation, thus overcoming dependence on specific inputs such as high quality singing templates or phoneme-score synchronization information. Specifically, we propose an encoder--decoder framework for our task. Given time-frequency representations of speech and a target melody contour, we learn encodings that enable us to synthesize singing that preserves the linguistic content and timbre of the speaker while adhering to the target melody. We also propose a multi-task learning based objective to improve lyric intelligibility. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06595">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 120	Pipeline Interventions</h3><h4>Eshwar Ram Arunachaleswaran, Sampath Kannan, Aaron Roth, Juba Ziani</h4> Abstract: We introduce the \emph{pipeline intervention} problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least} expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly characterize the "price of fairness" in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare and the highest social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that for polynomial width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in our positive results is essential. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06592">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 121	Exploring Neural Models for Parsing Natural Language into First-Order  Logic</h3><h4>Hrituraj Singh, Milan Aggrawal, Balaji Krishnamurthy</h4> Abstract: Semantic parsing is the task of obtaining machine-interpretable representations from natural language text. We consider one such formal representation - First-Order Logic (FOL) and explore the capability of neural models in parsing English sentences to FOL. We model FOL parsing as a sequence to sequence mapping task where given a natural language sentence, it is encoded into an intermediate representation using an LSTM followed by a decoder which sequentially generates the predicates in the corresponding FOL formula. We improve the standard encoder-decoder model by introducing a variable alignment mechanism that enables it to align variables across predicates in the predicted FOL. We further show the effectiveness of predicting the category of FOL entity - Unary, Binary, Variables and Scoped Entities, at each decoder step as an auxiliary task on improving the consistency of generated FOL. We perform rigorous evaluations and extensive ablations. We also aim to release our code as well as large scale FOL dataset along with models to aid further research in logic-based parsing and inference in NLP. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06544">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 122	Distributed Averaging Methods for Randomized Second Order Optimization</h3><h4>Burak Bartan, Mert Pilanci</h4> Abstract: We consider distributed optimization problems where forming the Hessian is computationally challenging and communication is a significant bottleneck. We develop unbiased parameter averaging methods for randomized second order optimization that employ sampling and sketching of the Hessian. Existing works do not take the bias of the estimators into consideration, which limits their application to massively parallel computation. We provide closed-form formulas for regularization parameters and step sizes that provably minimize the bias for sketched Newton directions. We also extend the framework of second order averaging methods to introduce an unbiased distributed optimization framework for heterogeneous computing systems with varying worker resources. Additionally, we demonstrate the implications of our theoretical findings via large scale experiments performed on a serverless computing platform. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06540">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 123	Distributed Sketching Methods for Privacy Preserving Regression</h3><h4>Burak Bartan, Mert Pilanci</h4> Abstract: In this work, we study distributed sketching methods for large scale regression problems. We leverage multiple randomized sketches for reducing the problem dimensions as well as preserving privacy and improving straggler resilience in asynchronous distributed systems. We derive novel approximation guarantees for classical sketching methods and analyze the accuracy of parameter averaging for distributed sketches. We consider random matrices including Gaussian, randomized Hadamard, uniform sampling and leverage score sampling in the distributed setting. Moreover, we propose a hybrid approach combining sampling and fast random projections for better computational efficiency. We illustrate the performance of distributed sketches in a serverless computing platform with large scale experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 124	Active Bayesian Assessment for Black-Box Classifiers</h3><h4>Disi Ji, Robert L. Logan IV, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</h4> Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to increased deployment of black-box classifiers across a wide variety of applications. In many such situations there is a crucial need to assess the performance of these pre-trained models, for instance to ensure sufficient predictive accuracy, or that class probabilities are well-calibrated. Furthermore, since labeled data may be scarce or costly to collect, it is desirable for such assessment be performed in an efficient manner. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach for model assessment that satisfies these desiderata. We develop inference strategies to quantify uncertainty for common assessment metrics (accuracy, misclassification cost, expected calibration error), and propose a framework for active assessment using this uncertainty to guide efficient selection of instances for labeling. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in experiments assessing the performance of modern neural classifiers (e.g., ResNet and BERT) on several standard image and text classification datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06532">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 125	Learning to Generate Multiple Style Transfer Outputs for an Input  Sentence</h3><h4>Kevin Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Ming-Ting Sun, Jan Kautz</h4> Abstract: Text style transfer refers to the task of rephrasing a given text in a different style. While various methods have been proposed to advance the state of the art, they often assume the transfer output follows a delta distribution, and thus their models cannot generate different style transfer results for a given input text. To address the limitation, we propose a one-to-many text style transfer framework. In contrast to prior works that learn a one-to-one mapping that converts an input sentence to one output sentence, our approach learns a one-to-many mapping that can convert an input sentence to multiple different output sentences, while preserving the input content. This is achieved by applying adversarial training with a latent decomposition scheme. Specifically, we decompose the latent representation of the input sentence to a style code that captures the language style variation and a content code that encodes the language style-independent content. We then combine the content code with the style code for generating a style transfer output. By combining the same content code with a different style code, we generate a different style transfer output. Extensive experimental results with comparisons to several text style transfer approaches on multiple public datasets using a diverse set of performance metrics validate effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 126	Tensor denoising and completion based on ordinal observations</h3><h4>Chanwoo Lee, Miaoyan Wang</h4> Abstract: Higher-order tensors arise frequently in applications such as neuroimaging, recommendation system, social network analysis, and psychological studies. We consider the problem of low-rank tensor estimation from possibly incomplete, ordinal-valued observations. Two related problems are studied, one on tensor denoising and another on tensor completion. We propose a multi-linear cumulative link model, develop a rank-constrained M-estimator, and obtain theoretical accuracy guarantees. Our mean squared error bound enjoys a faster convergence rate than previous results, and we show that the proposed estimator is minimax optimal under the class of low-rank models. Furthermore, the procedure developed serves as an efficient completion method which guarantees consistent recovery of an order-$K$ $(d,\ldots,d)$-dimensional low-rank tensor using only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(Kd)$ noisy, quantized observations. We demonstrate the outperformance of our approach over previous methods on the tasks of clustering and collaborative filtering. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06524">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 127	Convex Fairness Constrained Model Using Causal Effect Estimators</h3><h4>Hikaru Ogura, Akiko Takeda</h4> Abstract: Recent years have seen much research on fairness in machine learning. Here, mean difference (MD) or demographic parity is one of the most popular measures of fairness. However, MD quantifies not only discrimination but also explanatory bias which is the difference of outcomes justified by explanatory features. In this paper, we devise novel models, called FairCEEs, which remove discrimination while keeping explanatory bias. The models are based on estimators of causal effect utilizing propensity score analysis. We prove that FairCEEs with the squared loss theoretically outperform a naive MD constraint model. We provide an efficient algorithm for solving FairCEEs in regression and binary classification tasks. In our experiment on synthetic and real-world data in these two tasks, FairCEEs outperformed an existing model that considers explanatory bias in specific cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06501">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 128	Blind Adversarial Network Perturbations</h3><h4>Milad Nasr, Alireza Bahramali, Amir Houmansadr</h4> Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly used for various traffic analysis problems, such as website fingerprinting and flow correlation, as they outperform traditional (e.g., statistical) techniques by large margins. However, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: adversarial inputs to the model that get labeled incorrectly by the model due to small adversarial perturbations. In this paper, for the first time, we show that an adversary can defeat DNN-based traffic analysis techniques by applying \emph{adversarial perturbations} on the patterns of \emph{live} network traffic. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06495">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 130	Learning to Group: A Bottom-Up Framework for 3D Part Discovery in Unseen  Categories</h3><h4>Tiange Luo, Kaichun Mo, Zhiao Huang, Jiarui Xu, Siyu Hu, Liwei Wang, Hao Su</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of discovering 3D parts for objects in unseen categories. Being able to learn the geometry prior of parts and transfer this prior to unseen categories pose fundamental challenges on data-driven shape segmentation approaches. Formulated as a contextual bandit problem, we propose a learning-based agglomerative clustering framework which learns a grouping policy to progressively group small part proposals into bigger ones in a bottom-up fashion. At the core of our approach is to restrict the local context for extracting part-level features, which encourages the generalizability to unseen categories. On the large-scale fine-grained 3D part dataset, PartNet, we demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge of parts learned from 3 training categories to 21 unseen testing categories without seeing any annotated samples. Quantitative comparisons against four shape segmentation baselines shows that our approach achieve the state-of-the-art performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06478">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 131	Pitfalls of In-Domain Uncertainty Estimation and Ensembling in Deep  Learning</h3><h4>Arsenii Ashukha, Alexander Lyzhov, Dmitry Molchanov, Dmitry Vetrov</h4> Abstract: Uncertainty estimation and ensembling methods go hand-in-hand. Uncertainty estimation is one of the main benchmarks for assessment of ensembling performance. At the same time, deep learning ensembles have provided state-of-the-art results in uncertainty estimation. In this work, we focus on in-domain uncertainty for image classification. We explore the standards for its quantification and point out pitfalls of existing metrics. Avoiding these pitfalls, we perform a broad study of different ensembling techniques. To provide more insight in this study, we introduce the deep ensemble equivalent score (DEE) and show that many sophisticated ensembling techniques are equivalent to an ensemble of only few independently trained networks in terms of test performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06470">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 132	HighRes-net: Recursive Fusion for Multi-Frame Super-Resolution of  Satellite Imagery</h3><h4>Michel Deudon, Alfredo Kalaitzis, Israel Goytom, Md Rifat Arefin, Zhichao Lin, Kris Sankaran, Vincent Michalski, Samira E. Kahou, Julien Cornebise, Yoshua Bengio</h4> Abstract: Generative deep learning has sparked a new wave of Super-Resolution (SR) algorithms that enhance single images with impressive aesthetic results, albeit with imaginary details. Multi-frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) offers a more grounded approach to the ill-posed problem, by conditioning on multiple low-resolution views. This is important for satellite monitoring of human impact on the planet -- from deforestation, to human rights violations -- that depend on reliable imagery. To this end, we present HighRes-net, the first deep learning approach to MFSR that learns its sub-tasks in an end-to-end fashion: (i) co-registration, (ii) fusion, (iii) up-sampling, and (iv) registration-at-the-loss. Co-registration of low-resolution views is learned implicitly through a reference-frame channel, with no explicit registration mechanism. We learn a global fusion operator that is applied recursively on an arbitrary number of low-resolution pairs. We introduce a registered loss, by learning to align the SR output to a ground-truth through ShiftNet. We show that by learning deep representations of multiple views, we can super-resolve low-resolution signals and enhance Earth Observation data at scale. Our approach recently topped the European Space Agency's MFSR competition on real-world satellite imagery. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06460">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 133	Monotonic Cardinality Estimation of Similarity Selection: A Deep  Learning Approach</h3><h4>Yaoshu Wang, Chuan Xiao, Jianbin Qin, Xin Cao, Yifang Sun, Wei Wang, Makoto Onizuka</h4> Abstract: Due to the outstanding capability of capturing underlying data distributions, deep learning techniques have been recently utilized for a series of traditional database problems. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of utilizing deep learning for cardinality estimation of similarity selection. Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data management applications, especially for query optimization. Moreover, in some applications the estimated cardinality is supposed to be consistent and interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any data type and distance function. Our method consists of a feature extraction model and a regression model. The feature extraction model transforms original data and threshold to a Hamming space, in which a deep learning-based regression model is utilized to exploit the incremental property of cardinality w.r.t. the threshold for both accuracy and monotonicity. We develop a training strategy tailored to our model as well as techniques for fast estimation. We also discuss how to handle updates. We demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of our method through experiments, and show how it improves the performance of a query optimizer. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06442">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 134	Posterior Ratio Estimation for Latent Variables</h3><h4>Yulong Zhang, Mingxuan Yi, Song Liu, Mladen Kolar</h4> Abstract: Density Ratio Estimation has attracted attention from machine learning community due to its ability of comparing the underlying distributions of two datasets. However, in some applications, we want to compare distributions of \emph{latent} random variables that can be only inferred from observations. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating the ratio between two posterior probability density functions of a latent variable. Particularly, we assume the posterior ratio function can be well-approximated by a parametric model, which is then estimated using observed datasets and synthetic prior samples. We prove consistency of our estimator and the asymptotic normality of the estimated parameters as the number of prior samples tending to infinity. Finally, we validate our theories using numerical experiments and demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method through some real-world applications. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06410">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 135	HybridCite: A Hybrid Model for Context-Aware Citation Recommendation</h3><h4>Michael F√§rber, Ashwath Sampath</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation systems aim to recommend citations for either a complete paper or a small portion of text called a citation context. The process of recommending citations for citation contexts is called local citation recommendation and is the focus of this paper. In this paper, firstly, we develop citation recommendation approaches based on embeddings, topic modeling, and information retrieval techniques. We combine, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the best-performing algorithms into a semi-genetic hybrid recommender system for citation recommendation. We evaluate the single approaches and the hybrid approach offline based on several data sets, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and the MAG in combination with arXiv and ACL. We further conduct a user study for evaluating our approaches online. Our evaluation results show that a hybrid model containing embedding and information retrieval-based components outperforms its individual components and further algorithms by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06406">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 138	An IoT-Based System: Big Urban Traffic Data Mining Through Airborne  Pollutant Gases Analysis</h3><h4>Daniel. Firouzimagham, Mohammad. Sabouri, Fatemeh. Adhami</h4> Abstract: Nowadays, in developing countries including Iran, the number of vehicles is increasing due to growing population. This has recently led to waste time getting stuck in traffic, take more time for daily commute, and increase accidents. So it is necessary to control traffic congestion by traffic police officers, expand paths efficiently and choose the best way for decreasing the traffic by citizens. Therefore, it is important to have the knowledge of instant traffic in each lane. Todays, many traffic organization services such as traffic police officer and urban traffic control system use traffic cameras, inductive sensors, satellite images, radar sensors, ultrasonic technology and radio-frequency identification (RFID) for urban traffic diagnosis. But this method has some problems such as inefficiency in heavy traffic influenced by condition of the air and inability to detect parallel traffic. Our method suggested in this article detects traffic congestion based on IOT containing a smart system that gives us traffic congestion by calculating the air pollution amount in that area. According to conducted experiment, the results were satisfied. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06374">PDF</a>

Motivated by the recent success of BERT based pre-training technique for NLP and image-language tasks, VideoBERT and CBT are proposed to exploit BERT model for video and language pre-training using narrated instructional videos. Different from their works which only pre-train understanding task, we propose a unified video-language pre-training model for both understanding and generation tasks. Our model comprises of 4 components including two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder and a decoder with the Transformer backbone. We first pre-train our model to learn the universal representation for both video and language on a large instructional video dataset. Then we fine-tune the model on two multimodal tasks including understanding task (text-based video retrieval) and generation task (multimodal video captioning).

<h3>No. 140	Many-to-Many Voice Conversion using Conditional Cycle-Consistent  Adversarial Networks</h3><h4>Shindong Lee, BongGu Ko, Keonnyeong Lee, In-Chul Yoo, Dongsuk Yook</h4> Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion, showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the efficiency of the proposed method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06328">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 141	Small energy masking for improved neural network training for end-to-end  speech recognition</h3><h4>Chanwoo Kim, Kwangyoun Kim, Sathish Reddy Indurthi</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present a Small Energy Masking (SEM) algorithm, which masks inputs having values below a certain threshold. More specifically, a time-frequency bin is masked if the filterbank energy in this bin is less than a certain energy threshold. A uniform distribution is employed to randomly generate the ratio of this energy threshold to the peak filterbank energy of each utterance in decibels. The unmasked feature elements are scaled so that the total sum of the feature values remain the same through this masking procedure. This very simple algorithm shows relatively 11.2 % and 13.5 % Word Error Rate (WER) improvements on the standard LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets over the baseline end-to-end speech recognition system. Additionally, compared to the input dropout algorithm, SEM algorithm shows relatively 7.7 % and 11.6 % improvements on the same LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets. With a modified shallow-fusion technique with a Transformer LM, we obtained a 2.62 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and a 7.87 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-other set. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06312">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 142	Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing</h3><h4>Dongge Liu, Gidon Ernst, Toby Murray, Benjamin I. P.

It proposes a variation of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that formulates program exploration as sequential decisionmaking under uncertainty guided by the best-first search strategy. It relies on approximate path-preserving fuzzing, a novel instance of constrained random testing, which quickly generates many diverse inputs that likely target program parts of interest.

<h3>No. 143	Extreme Classification via Adversarial Softmax Approximation</h3><h4>Robert Bamler, Stephan Mandt</h4> Abstract: Training a classifier over a large number of classes, known as 'extreme classification', has become a topic of major interest with applications in technology, science, and e-commerce. Traditional softmax regression induces a gradient cost proportional to the number of classes $C$, which often is prohibitively expensive. A popular scalable softmax approximation relies on uniform negative sampling, which suffers from slow convergence due a poor signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a simple training method for drastically enhancing the gradient signal by drawing negative samples from an adversarial model that mimics the data distribution. Our contributions are three-fold: (i) an adversarial sampling mechanism that produces negative samples at a cost only logarithmic in $C$, thus still resulting in cheap gradient updates; (ii) a mathematical proof that this adversarial sampling minimizes the gradient variance while any bias due to non-uniform sampling can be removed; (iii) experimental results on large scale data sets that show a reduction of the training time by an order of magnitude relative to several competitive baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06298">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 144	Higher order co-occurrence tensors for hypergraphs via face-splitting</h3><h4>Bryan Bischof</h4> Abstract: A popular trick for computing a pairwise co-occurrence matrix is the product of an incidence matrix and its transpose. We present an analog for higher order tuple co-occurrences using the face-splitting product, or alternately known as the transpose Khatri-Rao product. These higher order co-occurrences encode the commonality of tokens in the company of other tokens, and thus generalize the mutual information commonly studied. We demonstrate this tensor's use via a popular NLP model, and hypergraph models of similarity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06285">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 145	Accurate Stress Assessment based on functional Near Infrared  Spectroscopy using Deep Learning Approach</h3><h4>Mahya Mirbagheri, Ata Jodeiri, Naser Hakimi, Vahid Zakeri, Seyed Kamaledin Setarehdan</h4> Abstract: Stress is known as one of the major factors threatening human health. A large number of studies have been performed in order to either assess or relieve stress by analyzing the brain and heart-related signals. In this study, signals produced by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain recorded from 10 healthy volunteers are employed to assess the stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task by means of a deep learning system. The proposed deep learning system consists of two main parts: First, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed to build informative feature maps. Then, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress existence probability. Experiment results showed that the trained fNIRS model performs stress classification by achieving 88.52 -+ 0.77% accuracy. Employment of the proposed deep learning system trained on the fNIRS measurements leads to higher stress classification accuracy than the existing methods proposed in fNIRS studies in which the same experimental procedure has been employed. The proposed method suggests better stability with lower variation in prediction. Furthermore, its low computational cost opens up the possibility to be applied in real-time stress assessment. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06282">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 146	TwinBERT: Distilling Knowledge to Twin-Structured BERT Models for  Efficient Retrieval</h3><h4>Wenhao Lu, Jian Jiao, Ruofei Zhang</h4> Abstract: Pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved great success in a wide variety of NLP tasks, while the superior performance comes with high demand in computational resources, which hinders the application in low-latency IR systems. We present TwinBERT model for effective and efficient retrieval, which has twin-structured BERT-like encoders to represent query and document respectively and a crossing layer to combine the embeddings and produce a similarity score. Different from BERT, where the two input sentences are concatenated and encoded together, TwinBERT decouples them during encoding and produces the embeddings for query and document independently, which allows document embeddings to be pre-computed offline and cached in memory. Thereupon, the computation left for run-time is from the query encoding and query-document crossing only. This single change can save large amount of computation time and resources, and therefore significantly improve serving efficiency. Moreover, a few well-designed network layers and training strategies are proposed to further reduce computational cost while at the same time keep the performance as remarkable as BERT model. Lastly, we develop two versions of TwinBERT for retrieval and relevance tasks correspondingly, and both of them achieve close or on-par performance to BERT-Base model. The model was trained following the teacher-student framework and evaluated with data from one of the major search engines. Experimental results showed that the inference time was significantly reduced and was firstly controlled around 20ms on CPUs while at the same time the performance gain from fine-tuned BERT-Base model was mostly retained. Integration of the models into production systems also demonstrated remarkable improvements on relevance metrics with negligible influence on latency. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06275">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 147	Single Unit Status in Deep Convolutional Neural Network Codes for Face  Identification: Sparseness Redefined</h3><h4>Connor J. Parde, Y. Ivette Col√≥n, Matthew Q. Hill, Carlos D. Castillo, Prithviraj Dhar, Alice J. O'Toole</h4> Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification develop representations that generalize over variable images, while retaining subject (e.g., gender) and image (e.g., viewpoint) information. Identity, gender, and viewpoint codes were studied at the "neural unit" and ensemble levels of a face-identification network. At the unit level, identification, gender classification, and viewpoint estimation were measured by deleting units to create variably-sized, randomly-sampled subspaces at the top network layer. Identification of 3,531 identities remained high (area under the ROC approximately 1.0) as dimensionality decreased from 512 units to 16 (0.95), 4 (0.80), and 2 (0.72) units. Individual identities separated statistically on every top-layer unit. Cross-unit responses were minimally correlated, indicating that units code non-redundant identity cues. This "distributed" code requires only a sparse, random sample of units to identify faces accurately. Gender classification declined gradually and viewpoint estimation fell steeply as dimensionality decreased. Individual units were weakly predictive of gender and viewpoint, but ensembles proved effective predictors. Therefore, distributed and sparse codes co-exist in the network units to represent different face attributes. At the ensemble level, principal component analysis of face representations showed that identity, gender, and viewpoint information separated into high-dimensional subspaces, ordered by explained variance. Identity, gender, and viewpoint information contributed to all individual unit responses, undercutting a neural tuning analogy for face attributes. Interpretation of neural-like codes from DCNNs, and by analogy, high-level visual codes, cannot be inferred from single unit responses. Instead, "meaning" is encoded by directions in the high-dimensional space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06274">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 148	TPLVM: Portfolio Construction by Student's $t$-process Latent Variable  Model</h3><h4>Yusuke Uchiyama, Kei Nakagawa</h4> Abstract: Optimal asset allocation is a key topic in modern finance theory. To realize the optimal asset allocation on investor's risk aversion, various portfolio construction methods have been proposed. Recently, the applications of machine learning are rapidly growing in the area of finance. In this article, we propose the Student's $t$-process latent variable model (TPLVM) to describe non-Gaussian fluctuations of financial timeseries by lower dimensional latent variables. Subsequently, we apply the TPLVM to minimum-variance portfolio as an alternative of existing nonlinear factor models. To test the performance of the proposed portfolio, we construct minimum-variance portfolios of global stock market indices based on the TPLVM or Gaussian process latent variable model. By comparing these portfolios, we confirm the proposed portfolio outperforms that of the existing Gaussian process latent variable model. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06243">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 149	Social-WaGDAT: Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction via Wasserstein  Graph Double-Attention Network</h3><h4>Jiachen Li, Hengbo Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka</h4> Abstract: Effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (like autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called Social-WaGDAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06241">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 150	Boosted Locality Sensitive Hashing: Discriminative Binary Codes for  Source Separation</h3><h4>Sunwoo Kim, Haici Yang, Minje Kim</h4> Abstract: Speech enhancement tasks have seen significant improvements with the advance of deep learning technology, but with the cost of increased computational complexity. In this study, we propose an adaptive boosting approach to learning locality sensitive hash codes, which represent audio spectra efficiently. We use the learned hash codes for single-channel speech denoising tasks as an alternative to a complex machine learning model, particularly to address the resource-constrained environments. Our adaptive boosting algorithm learns simple logistic regressors as the weak learners. Once trained, their binary classification results transform each spectrum of test noisy speech into a bit string. Simple bitwise operations calculate Hamming distance to find the K-nearest matching frames in the dictionary of training noisy speech spectra, whose associated ideal binary masks are averaged to estimate the denoising mask for that test mixture. Our proposed learning algorithm differs from AdaBoost in the sense that the projections are trained to minimize the distances between the self-similarity matrix of the hash codes and that of the original spectra, rather than the misclassification rate. We evaluate our discriminative hash codes on the TIMIT corpus with various noise types, and show comparative performance to deep learning methods in terms of denoising performance and complexity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06239">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 151	Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis in Persian Social  Media</h3><h4>Morteza Rohanian, Mostafa Salehi, Ali Darzi, Vahid Ranjbar</h4> Abstract: With the social media engagement on the rise, the resulting data can be used as a rich resource for analyzing and understanding different phenomena around us. A sentiment analysis system employs these data to find the attitude of social media users towards certain entities in a given document. In this paper we propose a sentiment analysis method for Persian text using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a feedforward Artificial Neural Network, that categorize sentences into two and five classes (considering their intensity) by applying a layer of convolution over input data through different filters. We evaluated the method on three different datasets of Persian social media texts using Area under Curve metric. The final results show the advantage of using CNN over earlier attempts at developing traditional machine learning methods for Persian texts sentiment classification especially for short texts. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06233">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 152	Top-K Training of GANs: Improving Generators by Making Critics Less  Critical</h3><h4>Samarth Sinha, Anirudh Goyal, Colin Raffel, Augustus Odena</h4> Abstract: We introduce a simple (one line of code) modification to the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training algorithm that materially improves results with no increase in computational cost: When updating the generator parameters, we simply zero out the gradient contributions from the elements of the batch that the critic scores as `least realistic'. Through experiments on many different GAN variants, we show that this `top-k update' procedure is a generally applicable improvement. In order to understand the nature of the improvement, we conduct extensive analysis on a simple mixture-of-Gaussians dataset and discover several interesting phenomena. Among these is that, when gradient updates are computed using the worst-scoring batch elements, samples can actually be pushed further away from the their nearest mode. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06224">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 153	Ensemble Slice Sampling</h3><h4>Minas Karamanis, Florian Beutler</h4> Abstract: Slice Sampling has emerged as a powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm that adapts to the characteristics of the target distribution with minimal hand-tuning. However, Slice Sampling's performance is highly sensitive to the user-specified initial length scale hyperparameter. Moreover, Slice Sampling generally struggles with poorly scaled or strongly correlated distributions. This paper introduces Ensemble Slice Sampling, a new class of algorithms that bypasses such difficulties by adaptively tuning the length scale. Furthermore, Ensemble Slice Sampling's performance is immune to linear correlations by exploiting an ensemble of parallel walkers. These algorithms are trivial to construct, require no hand-tuning, and can easily be implemented in parallel computing environments. Empirical tests show that Ensemble Slice Sampling can improve efficiency by more than an order of magnitude compared to conventional MCMC methods on highly correlated target distributions such as the Autoregressive Process of Order 1 and the Correlated Funnel distribution. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06212">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 154	Attentive Item2Vec: Neural Attentive User Representations</h3><h4>Oren Barkan, Avi Caciularu, Ori Katz, Noam Koenigstein</h4> Abstract: Factorization methods for recommender systems tend to represent users as a single latent vector. However, user behavior and interests may change in the context of the recommendations that are presented to the user. For example, in the case of movie recommendations, it is usually true that earlier user data is less informative than more recent data. However, it is possible that a certain early movie may become suddenly more relevant in the presence of a popular sequel movie. This is just a single example of a variety of possible dynamically altering user interests in the presence of a potential new recommendation. In this work, we present Attentive Item2vec (AI2V) - a novel attentive version of Item2vec (I2V). AI2V employs a context-target attention mechanism in order to learn and capture different characteristics of user historical behavior (context) with respect to a potential recommended item (target). The attentive context-target mechanism enables a final neural attentive user representation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AI2V on several datasets, where it is shown to outperform other baselines. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06205">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 155	An implicit function learning approach for parametric modal regression</h3><h4>Yangchen Pan, Ehsan Imani, Martha White, Amir-massoud Farahmand</h4> Abstract: For multi-valued functions---such as when the conditional distribution on targets given the inputs is multi-modal---standard regression approaches are not always desirable because they provide the conditional mean. Modal regression aims to instead find the conditional mode, but is restricted to nonparametric approaches. Such methods can be difficult to scale, and cannot benefit from parametric function approximation, like neural networks, which can learn complex relationships between inputs and targets. In this work, we propose a parametric modal regression algorithm, by using the implicit function theorem to develop an objective for learning a joint parameterized function over inputs and targets. We empirically demonstrate on several synthetic problems that our method (i) can learn multi-valued functions and produce the conditional modes, (ii) scales well to high-dimensional inputs and (iii) is even more effective for certain uni-modal problems, particularly for high frequency data where the joint function over inputs and targets can better capture the complex relationship between them. We then demonstrate that our method is practically useful in a real-world modal regression problem. We conclude by showing that our method provides small improvements on two regression datasets that have asymmetric distributions over the targets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06195">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 156	Piecewise Convex Function Estimation and Model Selection</h3><h4>Kurt S. Riedel</h4> Abstract: Given noisy data, function estimation is considered when the unknown function is known apriori to consist of a small number of regions where the function is either convex or concave. When the regions are known apriori, the estimate is reduced to a finite dimensional convex optimization in the dual space. When the number of regions is unknown, the model selection problem is to determine the number of convexity change points. We use a pilot estimator based on the expected number of false inflection points. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/1803.03903">PDF</a><h2>2020-02-18</h2>
<h3>No. 1	Retrain or not retrain? -- efficient pruning methods of deep CNN  networks</h3><h4>Marcin Pietron, Maciej Wielgosz</h4> Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) play a major role in image processing tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation. Very often CNN networks have from several to hundred stacked layers with several megabytes of weights. One of the possible methods to reduce complexity and memory footprint is pruning. Pruning is a process of removing weights which connect neurons from two adjacent layers in the network. The process of finding near optimal solution with specified drop in accuracy can be more sophisticated when DL model has higher number of convolutional layers. In the paper few approaches based on retraining and no retraining are described and compared together. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07051">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Bit Allocation for Multi-Task Collaborative Intelligence</h3><h4>Saeed Ranjbar Alvar, Ivan V. Bajiƒá</h4> Abstract: Recent studies have shown that collaborative intelligence (CI) is a promising framework for deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based services on mobile devices. In CI, a deep neural network is split between the mobile device and the cloud. Deep features obtained at the mobile are compressed and transferred to the cloud to complete the inference. So far, the methods in the literature focused on transferring a single deep feature tensor from the mobile to the cloud. Such methods are not applicable to some recent, high-performance networks with multiple branches and skip connections. In this paper, we propose the first bit allocation method for multi-stream, multi-task CI. We first establish a model for the joint distortion of the multiple tasks as a function of the bit rates assigned to different deep feature tensors. Then, using the proposed model, we solve the rate-distortion optimization problem under a total rate constraint to obtain the best rate allocation among the tensors to be transferred. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme compared to several alternative bit allocation methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07048">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Object-based Metamorphic Testing through Image Structuring</h3><h4>Adrian Wildandyawan, Yasuharu Nishi</h4> Abstract: Testing software is often costly due to the need of mass-producing test cases and providing a test oracle for it. This is often referred to as the oracle problem. One method that has been proposed in order to alleviate the oracle problem is metamorphic testing. Metamorphic testing produces new test cases by altering an existing test case, and uses the metamorphic relation between the inputs and the outputs of the System Under Test (SUT) to predict the expected outputs of the produced test cases. Metamorphic testing has often been used for image processing software, where changes are applied to the image's attributes to create new test cases with annotations that are the same as the original image. We refer to this existing method as the image-based metamorphic testing. In this research, we propose an object-based metamorphic testing and a composite metamorphic testing which combines different metamorphic testing approaches to relatively increase test coverage. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07046">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Back-and-Forth prediction for deep tensor compression</h3><h4>Hyomin Choi, Robert A. Cohen, Ivan V. Bajic</h4> Abstract: Recent AI applications such as Collaborative Intelligence with neural networks involve transferring deep feature tensors between various computing devices. This necessitates tensor compression in order to optimize the usage of bandwidth-constrained channels between devices. In this paper we present a prediction scheme called Back-and-Forth (BaF) prediction, developed for deep feature tensors, which allows us to dramatically reduce tensor size and improve its compressibility. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art object detector demonstrate that the proposed method allows us to significantly reduce the number of bits needed for compressing feature tensors extracted from deep within the model, with negligible degradation of the detection performance and without requiring any retraining of the network weights. We achieve a 62% and 75% reduction in tensor size while keeping the loss in accuracy of the network to less than 1% and 2%, respectively. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07036">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge  Tracing</h3><h4>Youngduck Choi, Youngnam Lee, Junghyun Cho, Jineon Baek, Byungsoo Kim, Yeongmin Cha, Dongmin Shin, Chan Bae, Jaewe Heo</h4> Abstract: Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07033">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Fully convolutional networks for structural health monitoring through  multivariate time series classification</h3><h4>Luca Rosafalco, Andrea Manzoni, Stefano Mariani, Alberto Corigliano</h4> Abstract: We propose a novel approach to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), aiming at the automatic identification of damage-sensitive features from data acquired through pervasive sensor systems. Damage detection and localization are formulated as classification problems, and tackled through Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). A supervised training of the proposed network architecture is performed on data extracted from numerical simulations of a physics-based model (playing the role of digital twin of the structure to be monitored) accounting for different damage scenarios. By relying on this simplified model of the structure, several load conditions are considered during the training phase of the FCN, whose architecture has been designed to deal with time series of different length. The training of the neural network is done before the monitoring system starts operating, thus enabling a real time damage classification. The numerical performances of the proposed strategy are assessed on a numerical benchmark case consisting of an eight-story shear building subjected to two load types, one of which modeling random vibrations due to low-energy seismicity. Measurement noise has been added to the responses of the structure to mimic the outputs of a real monitoring system. Extremely good classification capacities are shown: among the nine possible alternatives (represented by the healthy state and by a damage at any floor), damage is correctly classified in up to 95% of cases, thus showing the strong potential of the proposed approach in view of the application to real-life cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07032">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Reinforcement learning for the manipulation of eye tracking data</h3><h4>Wolfgang Fuhl</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach based on reinforcement learning for eye tracking data manipulation. It is based on two opposing agents, where one tries to classify the data correctly and the second agent looks for patterns in the data, which get manipulated to hide specific information. We show that our approach is successfully applicable to preserve the privacy of a subject. In addition, our approach allows to evaluate the importance of temporal, as well as spatial, information of eye tracking data for specific classification goals. In general, this approach can also be used for stimuli manipulation, making it interesting for gaze guidance. For this purpose, this work provides the theoretical basis, which is why we have also integrated a section on how to apply this method for gaze guidance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06806">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Hybrid Embedded Deep Stacked Sparse Autoencoder with w_LPPD SVM Ensemble</h3><h4>Yongming Li, Yan Lei, Pin Wang, Yuchuan Liu</h4> Abstract: Deep learning is a kind of feature learning method with strong nonliear feature transformation and becomes more and more important in many fields of artificial intelligence. Deep autoencoder is one representative method of the deep learning methods, and can effectively extract abstract the information of datasets. However, it does not consider the complementarity between the deep features and original features during deep feature transformation. Besides, it suffers from small sample problem. In order to solve these problems, a novel deep autoencoder - hybrid feature embedded stacked sparse autoencoder(HESSAE) has been proposed in this paper. HFESAE is capable to learn discriminant deep features with the help of embedding original features to filter weak hidden-layer outputs during training. For the issue that class representation ability of abstract information is limited by small sample problem, a feature fusion strategy has been designed aiming to combining abstract information learned by HFESAE with original feature and obtain hybrid features for feature reduction. The strategy is hybrid feature selection strategy based on L1 regularization followed by an support vector machine(SVM) ensemble model, in which weighted local discriminant preservation projection (w_LPPD), is designed and employed on each base classifier. At the end of this paper, several representative public datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that, the proposed feature learning method yields superior performance compared to other existing and state of art feature learning algorithms including some representative deep autoencoder methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06761">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	Neural Architecture Search over Decentralized Data</h3><h4>Mengwei Xu, Yuxin Zhao, Kaigui Bian, Gang Huang, Qiaozhu Mei, Xuanzhe Liu</h4> Abstract: To preserve user privacy while enabling mobile intelligence, techniques have been proposed to train deep neural networks on decentralized data. However, training over decentralized data makes the design of neural architecture quite difficult as it already was. Such difficulty is further amplified when designing and deploying different neural architectures for heterogeneous mobile platforms. In this work, we propose an automatic neural architecture search into the decentralized training, as a new DNN training paradigm called Federated Neural Architecture Search, namely federated NAS. To deal with the primary challenge of limited on-client computational and communication resources, we present FedNAS, a highly optimized framework for efficient federated NAS. FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model candidate re-training during the architecture search process, and incorporates three key optimizations: parallel candidates training on partial clients, early dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers. Tested on large-scale datasets and typical CNN architectures, FedNAS achieves comparable model accuracy as state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to two orders of magnitude compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06352">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	Mapping Motor Cortex Stimulation to Muscle Responses: A Deep Neural  Network Modeling Approach</h3><h4>Md Navid Akbar, Mathew Yarossi, Marc Martinez-Gost, Marc A. Sommer, Moritz Dannhauer, Sumientra Rampersad, Dana Brooks, Eugene Tunik, Deniz Erdoƒümu≈ü</h4> Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) that can reliably model muscle responses from corresponding brain stimulation has the potential to increase knowledge of coordinated motor control for numerous basic science and applied use cases. Such cases include the understanding of abnormal movement patterns due to neurological injury from stroke, and stimulation based interventions for neurological recovery such as paired associative stimulation. In this work, potential DNN models are explored and the one with the minimum squared errors is recommended for the optimal performance of the M2M-Net, a network that maps transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to corresponding muscle responses, using: a finite element simulation, an empirical neural response profile, a convolutional autoencoder, a separate deep network mapper, and recordings of multi-muscle activation. We discuss the rationale behind the different modeling approaches and architectures, and contrast their results. Additionally, to obtain a comparative insight of the trade-off between complexity and performance analysis, we explore different techniques, including the extension of two classical information criteria for M2M-Net. Finally, we find that the model analogous to mapping the motor cortex stimulation to a combination of direct and synergistic connection to the muscles performs the best, when the neural response profile is used at the input. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06250">PDF</a>

PG computes most features in a low precision and only a small proportion of important features in a higher precision to preserve accuracy. The proposed approach is applicable to a variety of DNN architectures and significantly reduces the computational cost of DNN execution with almost no accuracy loss. Our experiments indicate that PG achieves excellent results on CNNs, including statically compressed mobile-friendly networks such as ShuffleNet. Compared to the state-of-the-art prediction-based quantization schemes, PG achieves the same or higher accuracy with 2.4$\times$ less compute on ImageNet. PG furthermore applies to RNNs. Compared to 8-bit uniform quantization, PG obtains a 1.2% improvement in perplexity per word with 2.7$\times$ computational cost reduction on LSTM on the Penn Tree Bank dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07136">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Query-Efficient Physical Hard-Label Attacks on Deep Learning Visual  Classification</h3><h4>Ryan Feng, Jiefeng Chen, Nelson Manohar, Earlence Fernandes, Somesh Jha, Atul Prakash</h4> Abstract: We present Survival-OPT, a physical adversarial example algorithm in the black-box hard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the model prediction class label. Assuming such limited access to the model is more relevant for settings such as proprietary cyber-physical and cloud systems than the whitebox setting assumed by prior work. By leveraging the properties of physical attacks, we create a novel approach based on the survivability of perturbations corresponding to physical transformations. Through simply querying the model for hard-label predictions, we optimize perturbations to survive in many different physical conditions and show that adversarial examples remain a security risk to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) even in the hard-label threat model. We show that Survival-OPT is query-efficient and robust: using fewer than 200K queries, we successfully attack a stop sign to be misclassified as a speed limit 30 km/hr sign in 98.5% of video frames in a drive-by setting. Survival-OPT also outperforms our baseline combination of existing hard-label and physical approaches, which required over 10x more queries for less robust results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07088">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	PCSGAN: Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks  for Thermal and NIR to Visible Image Transformation</h3><h4>Kancharagunta Kishan Babu, Shiv Ram Dubey</h4> Abstract: In many real world scenarios, it is difficult to capture the images in the visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal (THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding. However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise losses (like L1 or L2) as the objective function for training. The quality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still not up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective functions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the transformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is introduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the perceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the adversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to judge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR scene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in terms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures.

<h3>No. 14	An optimal scheduling architecture for accelerating batch algorithms on  Neural Network processor architectures</h3><h4>Phani Kumar Nyshadham, Mohit Sinha, Biswajit Mishra, H S Vijay</h4> Abstract: In neural network topologies, algorithms are running on batches of data tensors. The batches of data are typically scheduled onto the computing cores which execute in parallel. For the algorithms running on batches of data, an optimal batch scheduling architecture is very much needed by suitably utilizing hardware resources - thereby resulting in significant reduction training and inference time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the batch algorithms for neural networks through a scheduling architecture enabling optimal compute power utilization. The proposed optimal scheduling architecture can be built into HW or can be implemented in SW alone which can be leveraged for accelerating batch algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture speeds up the batch algorithms compared to the previous solutions. The proposed idea applies to any HPC architecture meant for neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07062">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Meta-learning Extractors for Music Source Separation</h3><h4>David Samuel, Aditya Ganeshan, Jason Naradowsky</h4> Abstract: We propose a hierarchical meta-learning-inspired model for music source separation (Meta-TasNet) in which a generator model is used to predict the weights of individual extractor models. This enables efficient parameter-sharing, while still allowing for instrument-specific parameterization. Meta-TasNet is shown to be more effective than the models trained independently or in a multi-task setting, and achieve performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods. In comparison to the latter, our extractors contain fewer parameters and have faster run-time performance. We discuss important architectural considerations, and explore the costs and benefits of this approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07016">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Learning Architectures for Binary Networks</h3><h4>Kunal Pratap Singh, Dahyun Kim, Jonghyun Choi</h4> Abstract: Backbone architectures of most binary networks are well-known floating point architectures, such as the ResNet family. Questioning that the architectures designed for floating-point networks would not be the best for binary networks, we propose to search architectures for binary networks (BNAS). Specifically, based on the cell based search method, we define a new set of layer types, design a new cell template, and rediscover the utility of and propose to use the Zeroise layer to learn well-performing binary networks. In addition, we propose to diversify early search to learn better performing binary architectures. We show that our searched binary networks outperform state-of-the-art binary networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06963">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Citation Recommendation: Approaches and Datasets</h3><h4>Michael F√§rber, Adam Jatowt</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation describes the task of recommending citations for a given text. Due to the overload of published scientific works in recent years on the one hand, and the need to cite the most appropriate publications when writing scientific texts on the other hand, citation recommendation has emerged as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and evaluation data sets have been presented. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature survey has been conducted explicitly on citation recommendation. In this article, we give a thorough introduction into automatic citation recommendation research. We then present an overview of the approaches and data sets for citation recommendation and identify differences and commonalities using various dimensions. Last but not least, we shed light on the evaluation methods, and outline general challenges in the evaluation and how to meet them. We restrict ourselves to citation recommendation for scientific publications, as this document type has been studied the most in this area. However, many of the observations and discussions included in this survey are also applicable to other types of text, such as news articles and encyclopedic articles. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06961">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 18	Amplifying The Uncanny</h3><h4>Terence Broad, Frederic Fol Leymarie, Mick Grierson</h4> Abstract: Deep neural networks have become remarkably good at producing realistic deepfakes, images of people that are (to the untrained eye) indistinguishable from real images. These are produced by algorithms that learn to distinguish between real and fake images and are optimised to generate samples that the system deems realistic. This paper, and the resulting series of artworks Being Foiled explore the aesthetic outcome of inverting this process and instead optimising the system to generate images that it sees as being fake. Maximising the unlikelihood of the data and in turn, amplifying the uncanny nature of these machine hallucinations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06890">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	Large-scale biometry with interpretable neural network regression on UK  Biobank body MRI</h3><h4>Taro Langner, H√•kan Ahlstr√∂m, Joel Kullberg</h4> Abstract: The UK Biobank study has successfully imaged more than 32,000 volunteer participants with neck-to-knee body MRI. Each scan is linked to extensive metadata, providing a comprehensive survey of imaged anatomy and related health states. Despite its potential for research, this vast amount of data presents a challenge to established methods of evaluation, which often rely on manual input. To date, the range of reference values for cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is therefore incomplete. In this work, neural networks were trained for regression to infer various biological metrics from the neck-to-knee body MRI automatically. The approach requires no manual intervention or ground truth segmentations for training. The examined fields span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and dedicated liver scans. The standardized framework achieved a close fit to the target values (median R^2 > 0.97) in 7-fold cross-validation with the ResNet50. Interpretation of aggregated saliency maps suggests that the network correctly targets specific body regions and limbs, and learned to emulate different modalities. On several body composition metrics, the quality of the predictions is within the range of variability observed between established gold standard techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06862">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Hierarchical Rule Induction Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning</h3><h4>Sheng Hu, Yuqing Ma, Xianglong Liu, Yanlu Wei, Shihao Bai</h4> Abstract: Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to analyze information, discover rules at an intangible level, and solve problems in innovative ways. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of abstract reasoning. In the test, the subject is asked to identify the correct choice from the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM (e.g., a 3$\times$3 matrix), following the underlying rules inside the matrix. Recent studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved encouraging progress to accomplish the RPM test problems. Unfortunately, simply relying on the relation extraction at the matrix level, they fail to recognize the complex attribute patterns inside or across rows/columns of RPM. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a Hierarchical Rule Induction Network (HriNet), by intimating human induction strategies. HriNet extracts multiple granularity rule embeddings at different levels and integrates them through a gated embedding fusion module. We further introduce a rule similarity metric based on the embeddings, so that HriNet can not only be trained using a tuplet loss but also infer the best answer according to the similarity score. To comprehensively evaluate HriNet, we first fix the defects contained in the very recent RAVEN dataset and generate a new one named Balanced-RAVEN. Then extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale dataset PGM and our Balanced-RAVEN, the results of which show that HriNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06838">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Addressing the confounds of accompaniments in singer identification</h3><h4>Tsung-Han Hsieh, Kai-Hsiang Cheng, Zhe-Cheng Fan, Yu-Ching Yang, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: Identifying singers is an important task with many applications. However, the task remains challenging due to many issues. One major issue is related to the confounding factors from the background instrumental music that is mixed with the vocals in music production. A singer identification model may learn to extract non-vocal related features from the instrumental part of the songs, if a singer only sings in certain musical contexts (e.g., genres). The model cannot therefore generalize well when the singer sings in unseen contexts. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we employ open-unmix, an open source tool with state-of-the-art performance in source separation, to separate the vocal and instrumental tracks of music. We then investigate two means to train a singer identification model: by learning from the separated vocal only, or from an augmented set of data where we "shuffle-and-remix" the separated vocal tracks and instrumental tracks of different songs to artificially make the singers sing in different contexts. We also incorporate melodic features learned from the vocal melody contour for better performance. Evaluation results on a benchmark dataset called the artist20 shows that this data augmentation method greatly improves the accuracy of singer identification. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06817">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 23	How to 0wn NAS in Your Spare Time</h3><h4>Sanghyun Hong, Michael Davinroy, Yiƒüitcan Kaya, Dana Dachman-Soled, Tudor Dumitra≈ü</h4> Abstract: New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning systems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06776">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Superpixel Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks with  Regularized Information Maximization</h3><h4>Teppei Suzuki</h4> Abstract: We propose an unsupervised superpixel segmentation method by optimizing a randomly-initialized convolutional neural network (CNN) in inference time. Our method generates superpixels via CNN from a single image without any labels by minimizing a proposed objective function for superpixel segmentation in inference time. There are three advantages to our method compared with many of existing methods: (i) leverages an image prior of CNN for superpixel segmentation, (ii) adaptively changes the number of superpixels according to the given images, and (iii) controls the property of superpixels by adding an auxiliary cost to the objective function. We verify the advantages of our method quantitatively and qualitatively on BSDS500 and SBD datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06765">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) -- Exploring the Linguistic  Aspects of Visual Captioning in Indian Languages (Bengali) Using MSCOCO  Framework</h3><h4>Chiranjib Sur</h4> Abstract: In this work, we have introduced Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) for Better Semantic Selection for Indian regional language-based image captioning and introduced a procedure where we used the existing translation and English crowd-sourced sentences for training. We have shown that this architecture is a promising alternative source, where there is a crunch in resources. Our main contribution of this work is the development of deep learning architectures for the Bengali language (is the fifth widely spoken language in the world) with a completely different grammar and language attributes. We have shown that these are working well for complex applications like language generation from image contexts and can diversify the representation through introducing constraints, more extensive features, and unique feature spaces. We also established that we could achieve absolute precision and diversity when we use smoothened semantic tensor with the traditional LSTM and feature decomposition networks. With better learning architecture, we succeeded in establishing an automated algorithm and assessment procedure that can help in the evaluation of competent applications without the requirement for expertise and human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06701">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word  Models</h3><h4>Bin Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo</h4> Abstract: Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models. Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06652">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Coresets for the Nearest-Neighbor Rule</h3><h4>Alejandro Flores Velazco, David M. Mount</h4> Abstract: The problem of nearest-neighbor condensation deals with finding a subset R from a set of labeled points P such that for every point p in R the nearest-neighbor of p in R has the same label as p. This is motivated by applications in classification, where the nearest-neighbor rule assigns to an unlabeled query point the label of its nearest-neighbor in the point set. In this context, condensation aims to reduce the size of the set needed to classify new points. However, finding such subsets of minimum cardinality is NP-hard, and most research has focused on practical heuristics without performance guarantees. Additionally, the use of exact nearest-neighbors is always assumed, ignoring the effect of condensation in the classification accuracy when nearest-neighbors are computed approximately. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing new approximation-sensitive criteria for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem, along with practical algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We characterize sufficient conditions to guarantee correct classification of unlabeled points using approximate nearest-neighbor queries on these subsets, which introduces the notion of coresets for classification with the nearest-neighbor rule. Moreover, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute subsets with these characteristics, whose cardinality approximates that of the minimum cardinality subset. Additionally, we propose new algorithms for computing such subsets, with tight approximation factors in general metrics, and improved factors for doubling metrics and l_p metrics with p >= 2. Finally, we show an alternative implementation scheme that reduces the worst-case time complexity of one of these algorithms, becoming the first truly subquadratic approximation algorithm for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06650">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Speech-to-Singing Conversion in an Encoder-Decoder Framework</h3><h4>Jayneel Parekh, Preeti Rao, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: In this paper our goal is to convert a set of spoken lines into sung ones. Unlike previous signal processing based methods, we take a learning based approach to the problem. This allows us to automatically model various aspects of this transformation, thus overcoming dependence on specific inputs such as high quality singing templates or phoneme-score synchronization information. Specifically, we propose an encoder--decoder framework for our task. Given time-frequency representations of speech and a target melody contour, we learn encodings that enable us to synthesize singing that preserves the linguistic content and timbre of the speaker while adhering to the target melody. We also propose a multi-task learning based objective to improve lyric intelligibility. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06595">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Pipeline Interventions</h3><h4>Eshwar Ram Arunachaleswaran, Sampath Kannan, Aaron Roth, Juba Ziani</h4> Abstract: We introduce the \emph{pipeline intervention} problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least} expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly characterize the "price of fairness" in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare and the highest social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that for polynomial width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in our positive results is essential. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06592">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	Exploring Neural Models for Parsing Natural Language into First-Order  Logic</h3><h4>Hrituraj Singh, Milan Aggrawal, Balaji Krishnamurthy</h4> Abstract: Semantic parsing is the task of obtaining machine-interpretable representations from natural language text. We consider one such formal representation - First-Order Logic (FOL) and explore the capability of neural models in parsing English sentences to FOL. We model FOL parsing as a sequence to sequence mapping task where given a natural language sentence, it is encoded into an intermediate representation using an LSTM followed by a decoder which sequentially generates the predicates in the corresponding FOL formula. We improve the standard encoder-decoder model by introducing a variable alignment mechanism that enables it to align variables across predicates in the predicted FOL. We further show the effectiveness of predicting the category of FOL entity - Unary, Binary, Variables and Scoped Entities, at each decoder step as an auxiliary task on improving the consistency of generated FOL. We perform rigorous evaluations and extensive ablations. We also aim to release our code as well as large scale FOL dataset along with models to aid further research in logic-based parsing and inference in NLP. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06544">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	Distributed Sketching Methods for Privacy Preserving Regression</h3><h4>Burak Bartan, Mert Pilanci</h4> Abstract: In this work, we study distributed sketching methods for large scale regression problems. We leverage multiple randomized sketches for reducing the problem dimensions as well as preserving privacy and improving straggler resilience in asynchronous distributed systems. We derive novel approximation guarantees for classical sketching methods and analyze the accuracy of parameter averaging for distributed sketches. We consider random matrices including Gaussian, randomized Hadamard, uniform sampling and leverage score sampling in the distributed setting. Moreover, we propose a hybrid approach combining sampling and fast random projections for better computational efficiency. We illustrate the performance of distributed sketches in a serverless computing platform with large scale experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	Learning to Generate Multiple Style Transfer Outputs for an Input  Sentence</h3><h4>Kevin Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Ming-Ting Sun, Jan Kautz</h4> Abstract: Text style transfer refers to the task of rephrasing a given text in a different style. While various methods have been proposed to advance the state of the art, they often assume the transfer output follows a delta distribution, and thus their models cannot generate different style transfer results for a given input text. To address the limitation, we propose a one-to-many text style transfer framework. In contrast to prior works that learn a one-to-one mapping that converts an input sentence to one output sentence, our approach learns a one-to-many mapping that can convert an input sentence to multiple different output sentences, while preserving the input content. This is achieved by applying adversarial training with a latent decomposition scheme. Specifically, we decompose the latent representation of the input sentence to a style code that captures the language style variation and a content code that encodes the language style-independent content. We then combine the content code with the style code for generating a style transfer output. By combining the same content code with a different style code, we generate a different style transfer output. Extensive experimental results with comparisons to several text style transfer approaches on multiple public datasets using a diverse set of performance metrics validate effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Blind Adversarial Network Perturbations</h3><h4>Milad Nasr, Alireza Bahramali, Amir Houmansadr</h4> Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly used for various traffic analysis problems, such as website fingerprinting and flow correlation, as they outperform traditional (e.g., statistical) techniques by large margins. However, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: adversarial inputs to the model that get labeled incorrectly by the model due to small adversarial perturbations. In this paper, for the first time, we show that an adversary can defeat DNN-based traffic analysis techniques by applying \emph{adversarial perturbations} on the patterns of \emph{live} network traffic. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06495">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Learning to Group: A Bottom-Up Framework for 3D Part Discovery in Unseen  Categories</h3><h4>Tiange Luo, Kaichun Mo, Zhiao Huang, Jiarui Xu, Siyu Hu, Liwei Wang, Hao Su</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of discovering 3D parts for objects in unseen categories. Being able to learn the geometry prior of parts and transfer this prior to unseen categories pose fundamental challenges on data-driven shape segmentation approaches. Formulated as a contextual bandit problem, we propose a learning-based agglomerative clustering framework which learns a grouping policy to progressively group small part proposals into bigger ones in a bottom-up fashion. At the core of our approach is to restrict the local context for extracting part-level features, which encourages the generalizability to unseen categories. On the large-scale fine-grained 3D part dataset, PartNet, we demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge of parts learned from 3 training categories to 21 unseen testing categories without seeing any annotated samples. Quantitative comparisons against four shape segmentation baselines shows that our approach achieve the state-of-the-art performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06478">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Monotonic Cardinality Estimation of Similarity Selection: A Deep  Learning Approach</h3><h4>Yaoshu Wang, Chuan Xiao, Jianbin Qin, Xin Cao, Yifang Sun, Wei Wang, Makoto Onizuka</h4> Abstract: Due to the outstanding capability of capturing underlying data distributions, deep learning techniques have been recently utilized for a series of traditional database problems. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of utilizing deep learning for cardinality estimation of similarity selection. Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data management applications, especially for query optimization. Moreover, in some applications the estimated cardinality is supposed to be consistent and interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any data type and distance function. Our method consists of a feature extraction model and a regression model. The feature extraction model transforms original data and threshold to a Hamming space, in which a deep learning-based regression model is utilized to exploit the incremental property of cardinality w.r.t. the threshold for both accuracy and monotonicity. We develop a training strategy tailored to our model as well as techniques for fast estimation. We also discuss how to handle updates. We demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of our method through experiments, and show how it improves the performance of a query optimizer. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06442">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	HybridCite: A Hybrid Model for Context-Aware Citation Recommendation</h3><h4>Michael F√§rber, Ashwath Sampath</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation systems aim to recommend citations for either a complete paper or a small portion of text called a citation context. The process of recommending citations for citation contexts is called local citation recommendation and is the focus of this paper. In this paper, firstly, we develop citation recommendation approaches based on embeddings, topic modeling, and information retrieval techniques. We combine, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the best-performing algorithms into a semi-genetic hybrid recommender system for citation recommendation. We evaluate the single approaches and the hybrid approach offline based on several data sets, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and the MAG in combination with arXiv and ACL. We further conduct a user study for evaluating our approaches online. Our evaluation results show that a hybrid model containing embedding and information retrieval-based components outperforms its individual components and further algorithms by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06406">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	An IoT-Based System: Big Urban Traffic Data Mining Through Airborne  Pollutant Gases Analysis</h3><h4>Daniel. Firouzimagham, Mohammad. Sabouri, Fatemeh. Adhami</h4> Abstract: Nowadays, in developing countries including Iran, the number of vehicles is increasing due to growing population. This has recently led to waste time getting stuck in traffic, take more time for daily commute, and increase accidents. So it is necessary to control traffic congestion by traffic police officers, expand paths efficiently and choose the best way for decreasing the traffic by citizens. Therefore, it is important to have the knowledge of instant traffic in each lane. Todays, many traffic organization services such as traffic police officer and urban traffic control system use traffic cameras, inductive sensors, satellite images, radar sensors, ultrasonic technology and radio-frequency identification (RFID) for urban traffic diagnosis. But this method has some problems such as inefficiency in heavy traffic influenced by condition of the air and inability to detect parallel traffic. Our method suggested in this article detects traffic congestion based on IOT containing a smart system that gives us traffic congestion by calculating the air pollution amount in that area. According to conducted experiment, the results were satisfied. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06374">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	UniViLM: A Unified Video and Language Pre-Training Model for Multimodal  Understanding and Generation</h3><h4>Huaishao Luo, Lei Ji, Botian Shi, Haoyang Huang, Nan Duan, Tianrui Li, Xilin Chen, Ming Zhou</h4> Abstract: We propose UniViLM: a Unified Video and Language pre-training Model for multimodal understanding and generation. Motivated by the recent success of BERT based pre-training technique for NLP and image-language tasks, VideoBERT and CBT are proposed to exploit BERT model for video and language pre-training using narrated instructional videos. Different from their works which only pre-train understanding task, we propose a unified video-language pre-training model for both understanding and generation tasks. Our model comprises of 4 components including two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder and a decoder with the Transformer backbone. We first pre-train our model to learn the universal representation for both video and language on a large instructional video dataset. Then we fine-tune the model on two multimodal tasks including understanding task (text-based video retrieval) and generation task (multimodal video captioning). Our extensive experiments show that our method can improve the performance of both understanding and generation tasks and achieves the state-of-the art results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06353">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Many-to-Many Voice Conversion using Conditional Cycle-Consistent  Adversarial Networks</h3><h4>Shindong Lee, BongGu Ko, Keonnyeong Lee, In-Chul Yoo, Dongsuk Yook</h4> Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion, showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the efficiency of the proposed method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06328">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Small energy masking for improved neural network training for end-to-end  speech recognition</h3><h4>Chanwoo Kim, Kwangyoun Kim, Sathish Reddy Indurthi</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present a Small Energy Masking (SEM) algorithm, which masks inputs having values below a certain threshold. More specifically, a time-frequency bin is masked if the filterbank energy in this bin is less than a certain energy threshold. A uniform distribution is employed to randomly generate the ratio of this energy threshold to the peak filterbank energy of each utterance in decibels. The unmasked feature elements are scaled so that the total sum of the feature values remain the same through this masking procedure. This very simple algorithm shows relatively 11.2 % and 13.5 % Word Error Rate (WER) improvements on the standard LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets over the baseline end-to-end speech recognition system. Additionally, compared to the input dropout algorithm, SEM algorithm shows relatively 7.7 % and 11.6 % improvements on the same LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets. With a modified shallow-fusion technique with a Transformer LM, we obtained a 2.62 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and a 7.87 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-other set. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06312">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	Legion: Best-First Concolic Testing</h3><h4>Dongge Liu, Gidon Ernst, Toby Murray, Benjamin I. P. Rubinstein</h4> Abstract: Legion is a grey-box concolic tool that aims to balance the complementary nature of fuzzing and symbolic execution to achieve the best of both worlds. It proposes a variation of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that formulates program exploration as sequential decisionmaking under uncertainty guided by the best-first search strategy. It relies on approximate path-preserving fuzzing, a novel instance of constrained random testing, which quickly generates many diverse inputs that likely target program parts of interest. In Test-Comp 2020, the prototype performed within 90% of the best score in 9 of 22 categories. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06311">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 42	Accurate Stress Assessment based on functional Near Infrared  Spectroscopy using Deep Learning Approach</h3><h4>Mahya Mirbagheri, Ata Jodeiri, Naser Hakimi, Vahid Zakeri, Seyed Kamaledin Setarehdan</h4> Abstract: Stress is known as one of the major factors threatening human health. A large number of studies have been performed in order to either assess or relieve stress by analyzing the brain and heart-related signals. In this study, signals produced by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain recorded from 10 healthy volunteers are employed to assess the stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task by means of a deep learning system. The proposed deep learning system consists of two main parts: First, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed to build informative feature maps. Then, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress existence probability. Experiment results showed that the trained fNIRS model performs stress classification by achieving 88.52 -+ 0.77% accuracy. Employment of the proposed deep learning system trained on the fNIRS measurements leads to higher stress classification accuracy than the existing methods proposed in fNIRS studies in which the same experimental procedure has been employed. The proposed method suggests better stability with lower variation in prediction. Furthermore, its low computational cost opens up the possibility to be applied in real-time stress assessment. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06282">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	TwinBERT: Distilling Knowledge to Twin-Structured BERT Models for  Efficient Retrieval</h3><h4>Wenhao Lu, Jian Jiao, Ruofei Zhang</h4> Abstract: Pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved great success in a wide variety of NLP tasks, while the superior performance comes with high demand in computational resources, which hinders the application in low-latency IR systems. We present TwinBERT model for effective and efficient retrieval, which has twin-structured BERT-like encoders to represent query and document respectively and a crossing layer to combine the embeddings and produce a similarity score. Different from BERT, where the two input sentences are concatenated and encoded together, TwinBERT decouples them during encoding and produces the embeddings for query and document independently, which allows document embeddings to be pre-computed offline and cached in memory. Thereupon, the computation left for run-time is from the query encoding and query-document crossing only. This single change can save large amount of computation time and resources, and therefore significantly improve serving efficiency. Moreover, a few well-designed network layers and training strategies are proposed to further reduce computational cost while at the same time keep the performance as remarkable as BERT model. Lastly, we develop two versions of TwinBERT for retrieval and relevance tasks correspondingly, and both of them achieve close or on-par performance to BERT-Base model. The model was trained following the teacher-student framework and evaluated with data from one of the major search engines. Experimental results showed that the inference time was significantly reduced and was firstly controlled around 20ms on CPUs while at the same time the performance gain from fine-tuned BERT-Base model was mostly retained. Integration of the models into production systems also demonstrated remarkable improvements on relevance metrics with negligible influence on latency. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06275">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Single Unit Status in Deep Convolutional Neural Network Codes for Face  Identification: Sparseness Redefined</h3><h4>Connor J. Parde, Y. Ivette Col√≥n, Matthew Q. Hill, Carlos D. Castillo, Prithviraj Dhar, Alice J. O'Toole</h4> Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification develop representations that generalize over variable images, while retaining subject (e.g., gender) and image (e.g., viewpoint) information. Identity, gender, and viewpoint codes were studied at the "neural unit" and ensemble levels of a face-identification network. At the unit level, identification, gender classification, and viewpoint estimation were measured by deleting units to create variably-sized, randomly-sampled subspaces at the top network layer. Identification of 3,531 identities remained high (area under the ROC approximately 1.0) as dimensionality decreased from 512 units to 16 (0.95), 4 (0.80), and 2 (0.72) units. Individual identities separated statistically on every top-layer unit. Cross-unit responses were minimally correlated, indicating that units code non-redundant identity cues. This "distributed" code requires only a sparse, random sample of units to identify faces accurately. Gender classification declined gradually and viewpoint estimation fell steeply as dimensionality decreased. Individual units were weakly predictive of gender and viewpoint, but ensembles proved effective predictors. Therefore, distributed and sparse codes co-exist in the network units to represent different face attributes. At the ensemble level, principal component analysis of face representations showed that identity, gender, and viewpoint information separated into high-dimensional subspaces, ordered by explained variance. Identity, gender, and viewpoint information contributed to all individual unit responses, undercutting a neural tuning analogy for face attributes. Interpretation of neural-like codes from DCNNs, and by analogy, high-level visual codes, cannot be inferred from single unit responses. Instead, "meaning" is encoded by directions in the high-dimensional space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06274">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Social-WaGDAT: Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction via Wasserstein  Graph Double-Attention Network</h3><h4>Jiachen Li, Hengbo Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka</h4> Abstract: Effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (like autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called Social-WaGDAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06241">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	Boosted Locality Sensitive Hashing: Discriminative Binary Codes for  Source Separation</h3><h4>Sunwoo Kim, Haici Yang, Minje Kim</h4> Abstract: Speech enhancement tasks have seen significant improvements with the advance of deep learning technology, but with the cost of increased computational complexity. In this study, we propose an adaptive boosting approach to learning locality sensitive hash codes, which represent audio spectra efficiently. We use the learned hash codes for single-channel speech denoising tasks as an alternative to a complex machine learning model, particularly to address the resource-constrained environments. Our adaptive boosting algorithm learns simple logistic regressors as the weak learners. Once trained, their binary classification results transform each spectrum of test noisy speech into a bit string. Simple bitwise operations calculate Hamming distance to find the K-nearest matching frames in the dictionary of training noisy speech spectra, whose associated ideal binary masks are averaged to estimate the denoising mask for that test mixture. Our proposed learning algorithm differs from AdaBoost in the sense that the projections are trained to minimize the distances between the self-similarity matrix of the hash codes and that of the original spectra, rather than the misclassification rate. We evaluate our discriminative hash codes on the TIMIT corpus with various noise types, and show comparative performance to deep learning methods in terms of denoising performance and complexity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06239">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 47	Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis in Persian Social  Media</h3><h4>Morteza Rohanian, Mostafa Salehi, Ali Darzi, Vahid Ranjbar</h4> Abstract: With the social media engagement on the rise, the resulting data can be used as a rich resource for analyzing and understanding different phenomena around us. A sentiment analysis system employs these data to find the attitude of social media users towards certain entities in a given document. In this paper we propose a sentiment analysis method for Persian text using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a feedforward Artificial Neural Network, that categorize sentences into two and five classes (considering their intensity) by applying a layer of convolution over input data through different filters. We evaluated the method on three different datasets of Persian social media texts using Area under Curve metric. The final results show the advantage of using CNN over earlier attempts at developing traditional machine learning methods for Persian texts sentiment classification especially for short texts. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06233">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 48	Piecewise Convex Function Estimation and Model Selection</h3><h4>Kurt S. Riedel</h4> Abstract: Given noisy data, function estimation is considered when the unknown function is known apriori to consist of a small number of regions where the function is either convex or concave. When the regions are known apriori, the estimate is reduced to a finite dimensional convex optimization in the dual space. When the number of regions is unknown, the model selection problem is to determine the number of convexity change points. We use a pilot estimator based on the expected number of false inflection points. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/1803.03903">PDF</a>
