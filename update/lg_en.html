<h3>No. 1	Retrain or not retrain? -- efficient pruning methods of deep CNN  networks</h3><h4>Marcin Pietron, Maciej Wielgosz</h4> Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) play a major role in image processing tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation. Very often CNN networks have from several to hundred stacked layers with several megabytes of weights. One of the possible methods to reduce complexity and memory footprint is pruning. Pruning is a process of removing weights which connect neurons from two adjacent layers in the network. The process of finding near optimal solution with specified drop in accuracy can be more sophisticated when DL model has higher number of convolutional layers. In the paper few approaches based on retraining and no retraining are described and compared together. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07051">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Bit Allocation for Multi-Task Collaborative Intelligence</h3><h4>Saeed Ranjbar Alvar, Ivan V. BajiÄ‡</h4> Abstract: Recent studies have shown that collaborative intelligence (CI) is a promising framework for deployment of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based services on mobile devices. In CI, a deep neural network is split between the mobile device and the cloud. Deep features obtained at the mobile are compressed and transferred to the cloud to complete the inference. So far, the methods in the literature focused on transferring a single deep feature tensor from the mobile to the cloud. Such methods are not applicable to some recent, high-performance networks with multiple branches and skip connections. In this paper, we propose the first bit allocation method for multi-stream, multi-task CI. We first establish a model for the joint distortion of the multiple tasks as a function of the bit rates assigned to different deep feature tensors. Then, using the proposed model, we solve the rate-distortion optimization problem under a total rate constraint to obtain the best rate allocation among the tensors to be transferred. Experimental results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme compared to several alternative bit allocation methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07048">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Object-based Metamorphic Testing through Image Structuring</h3><h4>Adrian Wildandyawan, Yasuharu Nishi</h4> Abstract: Testing software is often costly due to the need of mass-producing test cases and providing a test oracle for it. This is often referred to as the oracle problem. One method that has been proposed in order to alleviate the oracle problem is metamorphic testing. Metamorphic testing produces new test cases by altering an existing test case, and uses the metamorphic relation between the inputs and the outputs of the System Under Test (SUT) to predict the expected outputs of the produced test cases. Metamorphic testing has often been used for image processing software, where changes are applied to the image's attributes to create new test cases with annotations that are the same as the original image. We refer to this existing method as the image-based metamorphic testing. In this research, we propose an object-based metamorphic testing and a composite metamorphic testing which combines different metamorphic testing approaches to relatively increase test coverage. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07046">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Back-and-Forth prediction for deep tensor compression</h3><h4>Hyomin Choi, Robert A. Cohen, Ivan V. Bajic</h4> Abstract: Recent AI applications such as Collaborative Intelligence with neural networks involve transferring deep feature tensors between various computing devices. This necessitates tensor compression in order to optimize the usage of bandwidth-constrained channels between devices. In this paper we present a prediction scheme called Back-and-Forth (BaF) prediction, developed for deep feature tensors, which allows us to dramatically reduce tensor size and improve its compressibility. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art object detector demonstrate that the proposed method allows us to significantly reduce the number of bits needed for compressing feature tensors extracted from deep within the model, with negligible degradation of the detection performance and without requiring any retraining of the network weights. We achieve a 62% and 75% reduction in tensor size while keeping the loss in accuracy of the network to less than 1% and 2%, respectively. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07036">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge  Tracing</h3><h4>Youngduck Choi, Youngnam Lee, Junghyun Cho, Jineon Baek, Byungsoo Kim, Yeongmin Cha, Dongmin Shin, Chan Bae, Jaewe Heo</h4> Abstract: Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07033">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Fully convolutional networks for structural health monitoring through  multivariate time series classification</h3><h4>Luca Rosafalco, Andrea Manzoni, Stefano Mariani, Alberto Corigliano</h4> Abstract: We propose a novel approach to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM), aiming at the automatic identification of damage-sensitive features from data acquired through pervasive sensor systems. Damage detection and localization are formulated as classification problems, and tackled through Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs). A supervised training of the proposed network architecture is performed on data extracted from numerical simulations of a physics-based model (playing the role of digital twin of the structure to be monitored) accounting for different damage scenarios. By relying on this simplified model of the structure, several load conditions are considered during the training phase of the FCN, whose architecture has been designed to deal with time series of different length. The training of the neural network is done before the monitoring system starts operating, thus enabling a real time damage classification. The numerical performances of the proposed strategy are assessed on a numerical benchmark case consisting of an eight-story shear building subjected to two load types, one of which modeling random vibrations due to low-energy seismicity. Measurement noise has been added to the responses of the structure to mimic the outputs of a real monitoring system. Extremely good classification capacities are shown: among the nine possible alternatives (represented by the healthy state and by a damage at any floor), damage is correctly classified in up to 95% of cases, thus showing the strong potential of the proposed approach in view of the application to real-life cases. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07032">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Reinforcement learning for the manipulation of eye tracking data</h3><h4>Wolfgang Fuhl</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach based on reinforcement learning for eye tracking data manipulation. It is based on two opposing agents, where one tries to classify the data correctly and the second agent looks for patterns in the data, which get manipulated to hide specific information. We show that our approach is successfully applicable to preserve the privacy of a subject. In addition, our approach allows to evaluate the importance of temporal, as well as spatial, information of eye tracking data for specific classification goals. In general, this approach can also be used for stimuli manipulation, making it interesting for gaze guidance. For this purpose, this work provides the theoretical basis, which is why we have also integrated a section on how to apply this method for gaze guidance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06806">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Hybrid Embedded Deep Stacked Sparse Autoencoder with w_LPPD SVM Ensemble</h3><h4>Yongming Li, Yan Lei, Pin Wang, Yuchuan Liu</h4> Abstract: Deep learning is a kind of feature learning method with strong nonliear feature transformation and becomes more and more important in many fields of artificial intelligence. Deep autoencoder is one representative method of the deep learning methods, and can effectively extract abstract the information of datasets. However, it does not consider the complementarity between the deep features and original features during deep feature transformation. Besides, it suffers from small sample problem. In order to solve these problems, a novel deep autoencoder - hybrid feature embedded stacked sparse autoencoder(HESSAE) has been proposed in this paper. HFESAE is capable to learn discriminant deep features with the help of embedding original features to filter weak hidden-layer outputs during training. For the issue that class representation ability of abstract information is limited by small sample problem, a feature fusion strategy has been designed aiming to combining abstract information learned by HFESAE with original feature and obtain hybrid features for feature reduction. The strategy is hybrid feature selection strategy based on L1 regularization followed by an support vector machine(SVM) ensemble model, in which weighted local discriminant preservation projection (w_LPPD), is designed and employed on each base classifier. At the end of this paper, several representative public datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that, the proposed feature learning method yields superior performance compared to other existing and state of art feature learning algorithms including some representative deep autoencoder methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06761">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	Neural Architecture Search over Decentralized Data</h3><h4>Mengwei Xu, Yuxin Zhao, Kaigui Bian, Gang Huang, Qiaozhu Mei, Xuanzhe Liu</h4> Abstract: To preserve user privacy while enabling mobile intelligence, techniques have been proposed to train deep neural networks on decentralized data. However, training over decentralized data makes the design of neural architecture quite difficult as it already was. Such difficulty is further amplified when designing and deploying different neural architectures for heterogeneous mobile platforms. In this work, we propose an automatic neural architecture search into the decentralized training, as a new DNN training paradigm called Federated Neural Architecture Search, namely federated NAS. To deal with the primary challenge of limited on-client computational and communication resources, we present FedNAS, a highly optimized framework for efficient federated NAS. FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model candidate re-training during the architecture search process, and incorporates three key optimizations: parallel candidates training on partial clients, early dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers. Tested on large-scale datasets and typical CNN architectures, FedNAS achieves comparable model accuracy as state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to two orders of magnitude compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06352">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	Mapping Motor Cortex Stimulation to Muscle Responses: A Deep Neural  Network Modeling Approach</h3><h4>Md Navid Akbar, Mathew Yarossi, Marc Martinez-Gost, Marc A. Sommer, Moritz Dannhauer, Sumientra Rampersad, Dana Brooks, Eugene Tunik, Deniz ErdoÄŸmuÅŸ</h4> Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) that can reliably model muscle responses from corresponding brain stimulation has the potential to increase knowledge of coordinated motor control for numerous basic science and applied use cases. Such cases include the understanding of abnormal movement patterns due to neurological injury from stroke, and stimulation based interventions for neurological recovery such as paired associative stimulation. In this work, potential DNN models are explored and the one with the minimum squared errors is recommended for the optimal performance of the M2M-Net, a network that maps transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to corresponding muscle responses, using: a finite element simulation, an empirical neural response profile, a convolutional autoencoder, a separate deep network mapper, and recordings of multi-muscle activation. We discuss the rationale behind the different modeling approaches and architectures, and contrast their results. Additionally, to obtain a comparative insight of the trade-off between complexity and performance analysis, we explore different techniques, including the extension of two classical information criteria for M2M-Net. Finally, we find that the model analogous to mapping the motor cortex stimulation to a combination of direct and synergistic connection to the muscles performs the best, when the neural response profile is used at the input. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06250">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Precision Gating: Improving Neural Network Efficiency with Dynamic  Dual-Precision Activations</h3><h4>Yichi Zhang, Ritchie Zhao, Weizhe Hua, Nayun Xu, G. Edward Suh, Zhiru Zhang</h4> Abstract: We propose precision gating (PG), an end-to-end trainable dynamic dual-precision quantization technique for deep neural networks. PG computes most features in a low precision and only a small proportion of important features in a higher precision to preserve accuracy. The proposed approach is applicable to a variety of DNN architectures and significantly reduces the computational cost of DNN execution with almost no accuracy loss. Our experiments indicate that PG achieves excellent results on CNNs, including statically compressed mobile-friendly networks such as ShuffleNet. Compared to the state-of-the-art prediction-based quantization schemes, PG achieves the same or higher accuracy with 2.4$\times$ less compute on ImageNet. PG furthermore applies to RNNs. Compared to 8-bit uniform quantization, PG obtains a 1.2% improvement in perplexity per word with 2.7$\times$ computational cost reduction on LSTM on the Penn Tree Bank dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07136">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Query-Efficient Physical Hard-Label Attacks on Deep Learning Visual  Classification</h3><h4>Ryan Feng, Jiefeng Chen, Nelson Manohar, Earlence Fernandes, Somesh Jha, Atul Prakash</h4> Abstract: We present Survival-OPT, a physical adversarial example algorithm in the black-box hard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the model prediction class label. Assuming such limited access to the model is more relevant for settings such as proprietary cyber-physical and cloud systems than the whitebox setting assumed by prior work. By leveraging the properties of physical attacks, we create a novel approach based on the survivability of perturbations corresponding to physical transformations. Through simply querying the model for hard-label predictions, we optimize perturbations to survive in many different physical conditions and show that adversarial examples remain a security risk to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) even in the hard-label threat model. We show that Survival-OPT is query-efficient and robust: using fewer than 200K queries, we successfully attack a stop sign to be misclassified as a speed limit 30 km/hr sign in 98.5% of video frames in a drive-by setting. Survival-OPT also outperforms our baseline combination of existing hard-label and physical approaches, which required over 10x more queries for less robust results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07088">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	PCSGAN: Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Networks  for Thermal and NIR to Visible Image Transformation</h3><h4>Kancharagunta Kishan Babu, Shiv Ram Dubey</h4> Abstract: In many real world scenarios, it is difficult to capture the images in the visible light spectrum (VIS) due to bad lighting conditions. However, the images can be captured in such scenarios using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Thermal (THM) cameras. The NIR and THM images contain the limited details. Thus, there is a need to transform the images from THM/NIR to VIS for better understanding. However, it is non-trivial task due to the large domain discrepancies and lack of abundant datasets. Nowadays, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is able to transform the images from one domain to another domain. Most of the available GAN based methods use the combination of the adversarial and the pixel-wise losses (like L1 or L2) as the objective function for training. The quality of transformed images in case of THM/NIR to VIS transformation is still not up to the mark using such objective function. Thus, better objective functions are needed to improve the quality, fine details and realism of the transformed images. A new model for THM/NIR to VIS image transformation called Perceptual Cyclic-Synthesized Generative Adversarial Network (PCSGAN) is introduced to address these issues. The PCSGAN uses the combination of the perceptual (i.e., feature based) losses along with the pixel-wise and the adversarial losses. Both the quantitative and qualitative measures are used to judge the performance of the PCSGAN model over the WHU-IIP face and the RGB-NIR scene datasets. The proposed PCSGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art image transformation models, including Pix2pix, DualGAN, CycleGAN, PS2GAN, and PAN in terms of the SSIM, MSE, PSNR and LPIPS evaluation measures.

<h3>No. 14	An optimal scheduling architecture for accelerating batch algorithms on  Neural Network processor architectures</h3><h4>Phani Kumar Nyshadham, Mohit Sinha, Biswajit Mishra, H S Vijay</h4> Abstract: In neural network topologies, algorithms are running on batches of data tensors. The batches of data are typically scheduled onto the computing cores which execute in parallel. For the algorithms running on batches of data, an optimal batch scheduling architecture is very much needed by suitably utilizing hardware resources - thereby resulting in significant reduction training and inference time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the batch algorithms for neural networks through a scheduling architecture enabling optimal compute power utilization. The proposed optimal scheduling architecture can be built into HW or can be implemented in SW alone which can be leveraged for accelerating batch algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture speeds up the batch algorithms compared to the previous solutions. The proposed idea applies to any HPC architecture meant for neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07062">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 15	Meta-learning Extractors for Music Source Separation</h3><h4>David Samuel, Aditya Ganeshan, Jason Naradowsky</h4> Abstract: We propose a hierarchical meta-learning-inspired model for music source separation (Meta-TasNet) in which a generator model is used to predict the weights of individual extractor models. This enables efficient parameter-sharing, while still allowing for instrument-specific parameterization. Meta-TasNet is shown to be more effective than the models trained independently or in a multi-task setting, and achieve performance comparable with state-of-the-art methods. In comparison to the latter, our extractors contain fewer parameters and have faster run-time performance. We discuss important architectural considerations, and explore the costs and benefits of this approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07016">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 16	Learning Architectures for Binary Networks</h3><h4>Kunal Pratap Singh, Dahyun Kim, Jonghyun Choi</h4> Abstract: Backbone architectures of most binary networks are well-known floating point architectures, such as the ResNet family. Questioning that the architectures designed for floating-point networks would not be the best for binary networks, we propose to search architectures for binary networks (BNAS). Specifically, based on the cell based search method, we define a new set of layer types, design a new cell template, and rediscover the utility of and propose to use the Zeroise layer to learn well-performing binary networks. In addition, we propose to diversify early search to learn better performing binary architectures. We show that our searched binary networks outperform state-of-the-art binary networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06963">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Citation Recommendation: Approaches and Datasets</h3><h4>Michael FÃ¤rber, Adam Jatowt</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation describes the task of recommending citations for a given text. Due to the overload of published scientific works in recent years on the one hand, and the need to cite the most appropriate publications when writing scientific texts on the other hand, citation recommendation has emerged as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and evaluation data sets have been presented. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature survey has been conducted explicitly on citation recommendation. In this article, we give a thorough introduction into automatic citation recommendation research. We then present an overview of the approaches and data sets for citation recommendation and identify differences and commonalities using various dimensions. Last but not least, we shed light on the evaluation methods, and outline general challenges in the evaluation and how to meet them. We restrict ourselves to citation recommendation for scientific publications, as this document type has been studied the most in this area. However, many of the observations and discussions included in this survey are also applicable to other types of text, such as news articles and encyclopedic articles. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06961">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 18	Amplifying The Uncanny</h3><h4>Terence Broad, Frederic Fol Leymarie, Mick Grierson</h4> Abstract: Deep neural networks have become remarkably good at producing realistic deepfakes, images of people that are (to the untrained eye) indistinguishable from real images. These are produced by algorithms that learn to distinguish between real and fake images and are optimised to generate samples that the system deems realistic. This paper, and the resulting series of artworks Being Foiled explore the aesthetic outcome of inverting this process and instead optimising the system to generate images that it sees as being fake. Maximising the unlikelihood of the data and in turn, amplifying the uncanny nature of these machine hallucinations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06890">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	Large-scale biometry with interpretable neural network regression on UK  Biobank body MRI</h3><h4>Taro Langner, HÃ¥kan AhlstrÃ¶m, Joel Kullberg</h4> Abstract: The UK Biobank study has successfully imaged more than 32,000 volunteer participants with neck-to-knee body MRI. Each scan is linked to extensive metadata, providing a comprehensive survey of imaged anatomy and related health states. Despite its potential for research, this vast amount of data presents a challenge to established methods of evaluation, which often rely on manual input. To date, the range of reference values for cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors is therefore incomplete. In this work, neural networks were trained for regression to infer various biological metrics from the neck-to-knee body MRI automatically. The approach requires no manual intervention or ground truth segmentations for training. The examined fields span 64 variables derived from anthropometric measurements, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), atlas-based segmentations, and dedicated liver scans. The standardized framework achieved a close fit to the target values (median R^2 > 0.97) in 7-fold cross-validation with the ResNet50. Interpretation of aggregated saliency maps suggests that the network correctly targets specific body regions and limbs, and learned to emulate different modalities. On several body composition metrics, the quality of the predictions is within the range of variability observed between established gold standard techniques. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06862">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Hierarchical Rule Induction Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning</h3><h4>Sheng Hu, Yuqing Ma, Xianglong Liu, Yanlu Wei, Shihao Bai</h4> Abstract: Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to analyze information, discover rules at an intangible level, and solve problems in innovative ways. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of abstract reasoning. In the test, the subject is asked to identify the correct choice from the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM (e.g., a 3$\times$3 matrix), following the underlying rules inside the matrix. Recent studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved encouraging progress to accomplish the RPM test problems. Unfortunately, simply relying on the relation extraction at the matrix level, they fail to recognize the complex attribute patterns inside or across rows/columns of RPM. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a Hierarchical Rule Induction Network (HriNet), by intimating human induction strategies. HriNet extracts multiple granularity rule embeddings at different levels and integrates them through a gated embedding fusion module. We further introduce a rule similarity metric based on the embeddings, so that HriNet can not only be trained using a tuplet loss but also infer the best answer according to the similarity score. To comprehensively evaluate HriNet, we first fix the defects contained in the very recent RAVEN dataset and generate a new one named Balanced-RAVEN. Then extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale dataset PGM and our Balanced-RAVEN, the results of which show that HriNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06838">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Addressing the confounds of accompaniments in singer identification</h3><h4>Tsung-Han Hsieh, Kai-Hsiang Cheng, Zhe-Cheng Fan, Yu-Ching Yang, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: Identifying singers is an important task with many applications. However, the task remains challenging due to many issues. One major issue is related to the confounding factors from the background instrumental music that is mixed with the vocals in music production. A singer identification model may learn to extract non-vocal related features from the instrumental part of the songs, if a singer only sings in certain musical contexts (e.g., genres). The model cannot therefore generalize well when the singer sings in unseen contexts. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue. Specifically, we employ open-unmix, an open source tool with state-of-the-art performance in source separation, to separate the vocal and instrumental tracks of music. We then investigate two means to train a singer identification model: by learning from the separated vocal only, or from an augmented set of data where we "shuffle-and-remix" the separated vocal tracks and instrumental tracks of different songs to artificially make the singers sing in different contexts. We also incorporate melodic features learned from the vocal melody contour for better performance. Evaluation results on a benchmark dataset called the artist20 shows that this data augmentation method greatly improves the accuracy of singer identification. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06817">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	Simulating Performance of ML Systems with Offline Profiling</h3><h4>Hongming Huang, Peng Cheng, Hong Xu, Yongqiang Xiong</h4> Abstract: We advocate that simulation based on offline profiling is a promising approach to better understand and improve the complex ML systems. Our approach uses operation-level profiling and dataflow based simulation to ensure it offers a unified and automated solution for all frameworks and ML models, and is also accurate by considering the various parallelization strategies in a real system. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06790">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	How to 0wn NAS in Your Spare Time</h3><h4>Sanghyun Hong, Michael Davinroy, YiÄŸitcan Kaya, Dana Dachman-Soled, Tudor DumitraÅŸ</h4> Abstract: New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning systems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06776">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Superpixel Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks with  Regularized Information Maximization</h3><h4>Teppei Suzuki</h4> Abstract: We propose an unsupervised superpixel segmentation method by optimizing a randomly-initialized convolutional neural network (CNN) in inference time. Our method generates superpixels via CNN from a single image without any labels by minimizing a proposed objective function for superpixel segmentation in inference time. There are three advantages to our method compared with many of existing methods: (i) leverages an image prior of CNN for superpixel segmentation, (ii) adaptively changes the number of superpixels according to the given images, and (iii) controls the property of superpixels by adding an auxiliary cost to the objective function. We verify the advantages of our method quantitatively and qualitatively on BSDS500 and SBD datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06765">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) -- Exploring the Linguistic  Aspects of Visual Captioning in Indian Languages (Bengali) Using MSCOCO  Framework</h3><h4>Chiranjib Sur</h4> Abstract: In this work, we have introduced Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) for Better Semantic Selection for Indian regional language-based image captioning and introduced a procedure where we used the existing translation and English crowd-sourced sentences for training. We have shown that this architecture is a promising alternative source, where there is a crunch in resources. Our main contribution of this work is the development of deep learning architectures for the Bengali language (is the fifth widely spoken language in the world) with a completely different grammar and language attributes. We have shown that these are working well for complex applications like language generation from image contexts and can diversify the representation through introducing constraints, more extensive features, and unique feature spaces. We also established that we could achieve absolute precision and diversity when we use smoothened semantic tensor with the traditional LSTM and feature decomposition networks. With better learning architecture, we succeeded in establishing an automated algorithm and assessment procedure that can help in the evaluation of competent applications without the requirement for expertise and human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06701">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word  Models</h3><h4>Bin Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo</h4> Abstract: Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models. Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06652">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Coresets for the Nearest-Neighbor Rule</h3><h4>Alejandro Flores Velazco, David M. Mount</h4> Abstract: The problem of nearest-neighbor condensation deals with finding a subset R from a set of labeled points P such that for every point p in R the nearest-neighbor of p in R has the same label as p. This is motivated by applications in classification, where the nearest-neighbor rule assigns to an unlabeled query point the label of its nearest-neighbor in the point set. In this context, condensation aims to reduce the size of the set needed to classify new points. However, finding such subsets of minimum cardinality is NP-hard, and most research has focused on practical heuristics without performance guarantees. Additionally, the use of exact nearest-neighbors is always assumed, ignoring the effect of condensation in the classification accuracy when nearest-neighbors are computed approximately. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing new approximation-sensitive criteria for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem, along with practical algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We characterize sufficient conditions to guarantee correct classification of unlabeled points using approximate nearest-neighbor queries on these subsets, which introduces the notion of coresets for classification with the nearest-neighbor rule. Moreover, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute subsets with these characteristics, whose cardinality approximates that of the minimum cardinality subset. Additionally, we propose new algorithms for computing such subsets, with tight approximation factors in general metrics, and improved factors for doubling metrics and l_p metrics with p >= 2. Finally, we show an alternative implementation scheme that reduces the worst-case time complexity of one of these algorithms, becoming the first truly subquadratic approximation algorithm for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06650">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Speech-to-Singing Conversion in an Encoder-Decoder Framework</h3><h4>Jayneel Parekh, Preeti Rao, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: In this paper our goal is to convert a set of spoken lines into sung ones. Unlike previous signal processing based methods, we take a learning based approach to the problem. This allows us to automatically model various aspects of this transformation, thus overcoming dependence on specific inputs such as high quality singing templates or phoneme-score synchronization information. Specifically, we propose an encoder--decoder framework for our task. Given time-frequency representations of speech and a target melody contour, we learn encodings that enable us to synthesize singing that preserves the linguistic content and timbre of the speaker while adhering to the target melody. We also propose a multi-task learning based objective to improve lyric intelligibility. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06595">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	Pipeline Interventions</h3><h4>Eshwar Ram Arunachaleswaran, Sampath Kannan, Aaron Roth, Juba Ziani</h4> Abstract: We introduce the \emph{pipeline intervention} problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least} expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly characterize the "price of fairness" in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare and the highest social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that for polynomial width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in our positive results is essential. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06592">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	Exploring Neural Models for Parsing Natural Language into First-Order  Logic</h3><h4>Hrituraj Singh, Milan Aggrawal, Balaji Krishnamurthy</h4> Abstract: Semantic parsing is the task of obtaining machine-interpretable representations from natural language text. We consider one such formal representation - First-Order Logic (FOL) and explore the capability of neural models in parsing English sentences to FOL. We model FOL parsing as a sequence to sequence mapping task where given a natural language sentence, it is encoded into an intermediate representation using an LSTM followed by a decoder which sequentially generates the predicates in the corresponding FOL formula. We improve the standard encoder-decoder model by introducing a variable alignment mechanism that enables it to align variables across predicates in the predicted FOL. We further show the effectiveness of predicting the category of FOL entity - Unary, Binary, Variables and Scoped Entities, at each decoder step as an auxiliary task on improving the consistency of generated FOL. We perform rigorous evaluations and extensive ablations. We also aim to release our code as well as large scale FOL dataset along with models to aid further research in logic-based parsing and inference in NLP. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06544">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	Distributed Sketching Methods for Privacy Preserving Regression</h3><h4>Burak Bartan, Mert Pilanci</h4> Abstract: In this work, we study distributed sketching methods for large scale regression problems. We leverage multiple randomized sketches for reducing the problem dimensions as well as preserving privacy and improving straggler resilience in asynchronous distributed systems. We derive novel approximation guarantees for classical sketching methods and analyze the accuracy of parameter averaging for distributed sketches. We consider random matrices including Gaussian, randomized Hadamard, uniform sampling and leverage score sampling in the distributed setting. Moreover, we propose a hybrid approach combining sampling and fast random projections for better computational efficiency. We illustrate the performance of distributed sketches in a serverless computing platform with large scale experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	Learning to Generate Multiple Style Transfer Outputs for an Input  Sentence</h3><h4>Kevin Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Ming-Ting Sun, Jan Kautz</h4> Abstract: Text style transfer refers to the task of rephrasing a given text in a different style. While various methods have been proposed to advance the state of the art, they often assume the transfer output follows a delta distribution, and thus their models cannot generate different style transfer results for a given input text. To address the limitation, we propose a one-to-many text style transfer framework. In contrast to prior works that learn a one-to-one mapping that converts an input sentence to one output sentence, our approach learns a one-to-many mapping that can convert an input sentence to multiple different output sentences, while preserving the input content. This is achieved by applying adversarial training with a latent decomposition scheme. Specifically, we decompose the latent representation of the input sentence to a style code that captures the language style variation and a content code that encodes the language style-independent content. We then combine the content code with the style code for generating a style transfer output. By combining the same content code with a different style code, we generate a different style transfer output. Extensive experimental results with comparisons to several text style transfer approaches on multiple public datasets using a diverse set of performance metrics validate effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Blind Adversarial Network Perturbations</h3><h4>Milad Nasr, Alireza Bahramali, Amir Houmansadr</h4> Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly used for various traffic analysis problems, such as website fingerprinting and flow correlation, as they outperform traditional (e.g., statistical) techniques by large margins. However, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: adversarial inputs to the model that get labeled incorrectly by the model due to small adversarial perturbations. In this paper, for the first time, we show that an adversary can defeat DNN-based traffic analysis techniques by applying \emph{adversarial perturbations} on the patterns of \emph{live} network traffic. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06495">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 34	Learning to Group: A Bottom-Up Framework for 3D Part Discovery in Unseen  Categories</h3><h4>Tiange Luo, Kaichun Mo, Zhiao Huang, Jiarui Xu, Siyu Hu, Liwei Wang, Hao Su</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of discovering 3D parts for objects in unseen categories. Being able to learn the geometry prior of parts and transfer this prior to unseen categories pose fundamental challenges on data-driven shape segmentation approaches. Formulated as a contextual bandit problem, we propose a learning-based agglomerative clustering framework which learns a grouping policy to progressively group small part proposals into bigger ones in a bottom-up fashion. At the core of our approach is to restrict the local context for extracting part-level features, which encourages the generalizability to unseen categories. On the large-scale fine-grained 3D part dataset, PartNet, we demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge of parts learned from 3 training categories to 21 unseen testing categories without seeing any annotated samples. Quantitative comparisons against four shape segmentation baselines shows that our approach achieve the state-of-the-art performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06478">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Monotonic Cardinality Estimation of Similarity Selection: A Deep  Learning Approach</h3><h4>Yaoshu Wang, Chuan Xiao, Jianbin Qin, Xin Cao, Yifang Sun, Wei Wang, Makoto Onizuka</h4> Abstract: Due to the outstanding capability of capturing underlying data distributions, deep learning techniques have been recently utilized for a series of traditional database problems. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of utilizing deep learning for cardinality estimation of similarity selection. Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data management applications, especially for query optimization. Moreover, in some applications the estimated cardinality is supposed to be consistent and interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any data type and distance function. Our method consists of a feature extraction model and a regression model. The feature extraction model transforms original data and threshold to a Hamming space, in which a deep learning-based regression model is utilized to exploit the incremental property of cardinality w.r.t. the threshold for both accuracy and monotonicity. We develop a training strategy tailored to our model as well as techniques for fast estimation. We also discuss how to handle updates. We demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of our method through experiments, and show how it improves the performance of a query optimizer. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06442">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	HybridCite: A Hybrid Model for Context-Aware Citation Recommendation</h3><h4>Michael FÃ¤rber, Ashwath Sampath</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation systems aim to recommend citations for either a complete paper or a small portion of text called a citation context. The process of recommending citations for citation contexts is called local citation recommendation and is the focus of this paper. In this paper, firstly, we develop citation recommendation approaches based on embeddings, topic modeling, and information retrieval techniques. We combine, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the best-performing algorithms into a semi-genetic hybrid recommender system for citation recommendation. We evaluate the single approaches and the hybrid approach offline based on several data sets, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and the MAG in combination with arXiv and ACL. We further conduct a user study for evaluating our approaches online. Our evaluation results show that a hybrid model containing embedding and information retrieval-based components outperforms its individual components and further algorithms by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06406">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	An IoT-Based System: Big Urban Traffic Data Mining Through Airborne  Pollutant Gases Analysis</h3><h4>Daniel. Firouzimagham, Mohammad. Sabouri, Fatemeh. Adhami</h4> Abstract: Nowadays, in developing countries including Iran, the number of vehicles is increasing due to growing population. This has recently led to waste time getting stuck in traffic, take more time for daily commute, and increase accidents. So it is necessary to control traffic congestion by traffic police officers, expand paths efficiently and choose the best way for decreasing the traffic by citizens. Therefore, it is important to have the knowledge of instant traffic in each lane. Todays, many traffic organization services such as traffic police officer and urban traffic control system use traffic cameras, inductive sensors, satellite images, radar sensors, ultrasonic technology and radio-frequency identification (RFID) for urban traffic diagnosis. But this method has some problems such as inefficiency in heavy traffic influenced by condition of the air and inability to detect parallel traffic. Our method suggested in this article detects traffic congestion based on IOT containing a smart system that gives us traffic congestion by calculating the air pollution amount in that area. According to conducted experiment, the results were satisfied. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06374">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	UniViLM: A Unified Video and Language Pre-Training Model for Multimodal  Understanding and Generation</h3><h4>Huaishao Luo, Lei Ji, Botian Shi, Haoyang Huang, Nan Duan, Tianrui Li, Xilin Chen, Ming Zhou</h4> Abstract: We propose UniViLM: a Unified Video and Language pre-training Model for multimodal understanding and generation. Motivated by the recent success of BERT based pre-training technique for NLP and image-language tasks, VideoBERT and CBT are proposed to exploit BERT model for video and language pre-training using narrated instructional videos. Different from their works which only pre-train understanding task, we propose a unified video-language pre-training model for both understanding and generation tasks. Our model comprises of 4 components including two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder and a decoder with the Transformer backbone. We first pre-train our model to learn the universal representation for both video and language on a large instructional video dataset. Then we fine-tune the model on two multimodal tasks including understanding task (text-based video retrieval) and generation task (multimodal video captioning). Our extensive experiments show that our method can improve the performance of both understanding and generation tasks and achieves the state-of-the art results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06353">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Many-to-Many Voice Conversion using Conditional Cycle-Consistent  Adversarial Networks</h3><h4>Shindong Lee, BongGu Ko, Keonnyeong Lee, In-Chul Yoo, Dongsuk Yook</h4> Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion, showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the efficiency of the proposed method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06328">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Small energy masking for improved neural network training for end-to-end  speech recognition</h3><h4>Chanwoo Kim, Kwangyoun Kim, Sathish Reddy Indurthi</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present a Small Energy Masking (SEM) algorithm, which masks inputs having values below a certain threshold. More specifically, a time-frequency bin is masked if the filterbank energy in this bin is less than a certain energy threshold. A uniform distribution is employed to randomly generate the ratio of this energy threshold to the peak filterbank energy of each utterance in decibels. The unmasked feature elements are scaled so that the total sum of the feature values remain the same through this masking procedure. This very simple algorithm shows relatively 11.2 % and 13.5 % Word Error Rate (WER) improvements on the standard LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets over the baseline end-to-end speech recognition system. Additionally, compared to the input dropout algorithm, SEM algorithm shows relatively 7.7 % and 11.6 % improvements on the same LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets. With a modified shallow-fusion technique with a Transformer LM, we obtained a 2.62 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and a 7.87 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-other set. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06312">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 42	Accurate Stress Assessment based on functional Near Infrared  Spectroscopy using Deep Learning Approach</h3><h4>Mahya Mirbagheri, Ata Jodeiri, Naser Hakimi, Vahid Zakeri, Seyed Kamaledin Setarehdan</h4> Abstract: Stress is known as one of the major factors threatening human health. A large number of studies have been performed in order to either assess or relieve stress by analyzing the brain and heart-related signals. In this study, signals produced by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain recorded from 10 healthy volunteers are employed to assess the stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task by means of a deep learning system. The proposed deep learning system consists of two main parts: First, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed to build informative feature maps. Then, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress existence probability. Experiment results showed that the trained fNIRS model performs stress classification by achieving 88.52 -+ 0.77% accuracy. Employment of the proposed deep learning system trained on the fNIRS measurements leads to higher stress classification accuracy than the existing methods proposed in fNIRS studies in which the same experimental procedure has been employed. The proposed method suggests better stability with lower variation in prediction. Furthermore, its low computational cost opens up the possibility to be applied in real-time stress assessment. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06282">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 43	TwinBERT: Distilling Knowledge to Twin-Structured BERT Models for  Efficient Retrieval</h3><h4>Wenhao Lu, Jian Jiao, Ruofei Zhang</h4> Abstract: Pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved great success in a wide variety of NLP tasks, while the superior performance comes with high demand in computational resources, which hinders the application in low-latency IR systems. We present TwinBERT model for effective and efficient retrieval, which has twin-structured BERT-like encoders to represent query and document respectively and a crossing layer to combine the embeddings and produce a similarity score. Different from BERT, where the two input sentences are concatenated and encoded together, TwinBERT decouples them during encoding and produces the embeddings for query and document independently, which allows document embeddings to be pre-computed offline and cached in memory. Thereupon, the computation left for run-time is from the query encoding and query-document crossing only. This single change can save large amount of computation time and resources, and therefore significantly improve serving efficiency. Moreover, a few well-designed network layers and training strategies are proposed to further reduce computational cost while at the same time keep the performance as remarkable as BERT model. Lastly, we develop two versions of TwinBERT for retrieval and relevance tasks correspondingly, and both of them achieve close or on-par performance to BERT-Base model. The model was trained following the teacher-student framework and evaluated with data from one of the major search engines. Experimental results showed that the inference time was significantly reduced and was firstly controlled around 20ms on CPUs while at the same time the performance gain from fine-tuned BERT-Base model was mostly retained. Integration of the models into production systems also demonstrated remarkable improvements on relevance metrics with negligible influence on latency. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06275">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 44	Single Unit Status in Deep Convolutional Neural Network Codes for Face  Identification: Sparseness Redefined</h3><h4>Connor J. Parde, Y. Ivette ColÃ³n, Matthew Q. Hill, Carlos D. Castillo, Prithviraj Dhar, Alice J. O'Toole</h4> Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification develop representations that generalize over variable images, while retaining subject (e.g., gender) and image (e.g., viewpoint) information. Identity, gender, and viewpoint codes were studied at the "neural unit" and ensemble levels of a face-identification network. At the unit level, identification, gender classification, and viewpoint estimation were measured by deleting units to create variably-sized, randomly-sampled subspaces at the top network layer. Identification of 3,531 identities remained high (area under the ROC approximately 1.0) as dimensionality decreased from 512 units to 16 (0.95), 4 (0.80), and 2 (0.72) units. Individual identities separated statistically on every top-layer unit. Cross-unit responses were minimally correlated, indicating that units code non-redundant identity cues. This "distributed" code requires only a sparse, random sample of units to identify faces accurately. Gender classification declined gradually and viewpoint estimation fell steeply as dimensionality decreased. Individual units were weakly predictive of gender and viewpoint, but ensembles proved effective predictors. Therefore, distributed and sparse codes co-exist in the network units to represent different face attributes. At the ensemble level, principal component analysis of face representations showed that identity, gender, and viewpoint information separated into high-dimensional subspaces, ordered by explained variance. Identity, gender, and viewpoint information contributed to all individual unit responses, undercutting a neural tuning analogy for face attributes. Interpretation of neural-like codes from DCNNs, and by analogy, high-level visual codes, cannot be inferred from single unit responses. Instead, "meaning" is encoded by directions in the high-dimensional space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06274">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 45	Social-WaGDAT: Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction via Wasserstein  Graph Double-Attention Network</h3><h4>Jiachen Li, Hengbo Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka</h4> Abstract: Effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (like autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called Social-WaGDAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06241">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 46	Boosted Locality Sensitive Hashing: Discriminative Binary Codes for  Source Separation</h3><h4>Sunwoo Kim, Haici Yang, Minje Kim</h4> Abstract: Speech enhancement tasks have seen significant improvements with the advance of deep learning technology, but with the cost of increased computational complexity. In this study, we propose an adaptive boosting approach to learning locality sensitive hash codes, which represent audio spectra efficiently. We use the learned hash codes for single-channel speech denoising tasks as an alternative to a complex machine learning model, particularly to address the resource-constrained environments. Our adaptive boosting algorithm learns simple logistic regressors as the weak learners. Once trained, their binary classification results transform each spectrum of test noisy speech into a bit string. Simple bitwise operations calculate Hamming distance to find the K-nearest matching frames in the dictionary of training noisy speech spectra, whose associated ideal binary masks are averaged to estimate the denoising mask for that test mixture. Our proposed learning algorithm differs from AdaBoost in the sense that the projections are trained to minimize the distances between the self-similarity matrix of the hash codes and that of the original spectra, rather than the misclassification rate. We evaluate our discriminative hash codes on the TIMIT corpus with various noise types, and show comparative performance to deep learning methods in terms of denoising performance and complexity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06239">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 48	Piecewise Convex Function Estimation and Model Selection</h3><h4>Kurt S.

When the regions are known apriori, the estimate is reduced to a finite dimensional convex optimization in the dual space. When the number of regions is unknown, the model selection problem is to determine the number of convexity change points.

<h3>No. 1	Retrain or not retrain? -- efficient pruning methods of deep CNN  networks</h3><h4>Marcin Pietron, Maciej Wielgosz</h4> Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) play a major role in image processing tasks like image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation. Very often CNN networks have from several to hundred stacked layers with several megabytes of weights. One of the possible methods to reduce complexity and memory footprint is pruning. Pruning is a process of removing weights which connect neurons from two adjacent layers in the network. The process of finding near optimal solution with specified drop in accuracy can be more sophisticated when DL model has higher number of convolutional layers. In the paper few approaches based on retraining and no retraining are described and compared together. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07051">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 2	Object-based Metamorphic Testing through Image Structuring</h3><h4>Adrian Wildandyawan, Yasuharu Nishi</h4> Abstract: Testing software is often costly due to the need of mass-producing test cases and providing a test oracle for it. This is often referred to as the oracle problem. One method that has been proposed in order to alleviate the oracle problem is metamorphic testing. Metamorphic testing produces new test cases by altering an existing test case, and uses the metamorphic relation between the inputs and the outputs of the System Under Test (SUT) to predict the expected outputs of the produced test cases. Metamorphic testing has often been used for image processing software, where changes are applied to the image's attributes to create new test cases with annotations that are the same as the original image. We refer to this existing method as the image-based metamorphic testing. In this research, we propose an object-based metamorphic testing and a composite metamorphic testing which combines different metamorphic testing approaches to relatively increase test coverage. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07046">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 3	Towards an Appropriate Query, Key, and Value Computation for Knowledge  Tracing</h3><h4>Youngduck Choi, Youngnam Lee, Junghyun Cho, Jineon Baek, Byungsoo Kim, Yeongmin Cha, Dongmin Shin, Chan Bae, Jaewe Heo</h4> Abstract: Knowledge tracing, the act of modeling a student's knowledge through learning activities, is an extensively studied problem in the field of computer-aided education. Although models with attention mechanism have outperformed traditional approaches such as Bayesian knowledge tracing and collaborative filtering, they share two limitations. Firstly, the models rely on shallow attention layers and fail to capture complex relations among exercises and responses over time. Secondly, different combinations of queries, keys and values for the self-attention layer for knowledge tracing were not extensively explored. Usual practice of using exercises and interactions (exercise-response pairs) as queries and keys/values respectively lacks empirical support. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model for knowledge tracing, SAINT: Separated Self-AttentIve Neural Knowledge Tracing. SAINT has an encoder-decoder structure where exercise and response embedding sequence separately enter the encoder and the decoder respectively, which allows to stack attention layers multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to suggest an encoder-decoder model for knowledge tracing that applies deep self-attentive layers to exercises and responses separately. The empirical evaluations on a large-scale knowledge tracing dataset show that SAINT achieves the state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with the improvement of AUC by 1.8% compared to the current state-of-the-art models. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07033">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 4	Reinforcement learning for the manipulation of eye tracking data</h3><h4>Wolfgang Fuhl</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach based on reinforcement learning for eye tracking data manipulation. It is based on two opposing agents, where one tries to classify the data correctly and the second agent looks for patterns in the data, which get manipulated to hide specific information. We show that our approach is successfully applicable to preserve the privacy of a subject. In addition, our approach allows to evaluate the importance of temporal, as well as spatial, information of eye tracking data for specific classification goals. In general, this approach can also be used for stimuli manipulation, making it interesting for gaze guidance. For this purpose, this work provides the theoretical basis, which is why we have also integrated a section on how to apply this method for gaze guidance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06806">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 5	Hybrid Embedded Deep Stacked Sparse Autoencoder with w_LPPD SVM Ensemble</h3><h4>Yongming Li, Yan Lei, Pin Wang, Yuchuan Liu</h4> Abstract: Deep learning is a kind of feature learning method with strong nonliear feature transformation and becomes more and more important in many fields of artificial intelligence. Deep autoencoder is one representative method of the deep learning methods, and can effectively extract abstract the information of datasets. However, it does not consider the complementarity between the deep features and original features during deep feature transformation. Besides, it suffers from small sample problem. In order to solve these problems, a novel deep autoencoder - hybrid feature embedded stacked sparse autoencoder(HESSAE) has been proposed in this paper. HFESAE is capable to learn discriminant deep features with the help of embedding original features to filter weak hidden-layer outputs during training. For the issue that class representation ability of abstract information is limited by small sample problem, a feature fusion strategy has been designed aiming to combining abstract information learned by HFESAE with original feature and obtain hybrid features for feature reduction. The strategy is hybrid feature selection strategy based on L1 regularization followed by an support vector machine(SVM) ensemble model, in which weighted local discriminant preservation projection (w_LPPD), is designed and employed on each base classifier. At the end of this paper, several representative public datasets are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that, the proposed feature learning method yields superior performance compared to other existing and state of art feature learning algorithms including some representative deep autoencoder methods. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06761">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 6	Neural Architecture Search over Decentralized Data</h3><h4>Mengwei Xu, Yuxin Zhao, Kaigui Bian, Gang Huang, Qiaozhu Mei, Xuanzhe Liu</h4> Abstract: To preserve user privacy while enabling mobile intelligence, techniques have been proposed to train deep neural networks on decentralized data. However, training over decentralized data makes the design of neural architecture quite difficult as it already was. Such difficulty is further amplified when designing and deploying different neural architectures for heterogeneous mobile platforms. In this work, we propose an automatic neural architecture search into the decentralized training, as a new DNN training paradigm called Federated Neural Architecture Search, namely federated NAS. To deal with the primary challenge of limited on-client computational and communication resources, we present FedNAS, a highly optimized framework for efficient federated NAS. FedNAS fully exploits the key opportunity of insufficient model candidate re-training during the architecture search process, and incorporates three key optimizations: parallel candidates training on partial clients, early dropping candidates with inferior performance, and dynamic round numbers. Tested on large-scale datasets and typical CNN architectures, FedNAS achieves comparable model accuracy as state-of-the-art NAS algorithm that trains models with centralized data, and also reduces the client cost by up to two orders of magnitude compared to a straightforward design of federated NAS. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06352">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 7	Mapping Motor Cortex Stimulation to Muscle Responses: A Deep Neural  Network Modeling Approach</h3><h4>Md Navid Akbar, Mathew Yarossi, Marc Martinez-Gost, Marc A. Sommer, Moritz Dannhauer, Sumientra Rampersad, Dana Brooks, Eugene Tunik, Deniz ErdoÄŸmuÅŸ</h4> Abstract: A deep neural network (DNN) that can reliably model muscle responses from corresponding brain stimulation has the potential to increase knowledge of coordinated motor control for numerous basic science and applied use cases. Such cases include the understanding of abnormal movement patterns due to neurological injury from stroke, and stimulation based interventions for neurological recovery such as paired associative stimulation. In this work, potential DNN models are explored and the one with the minimum squared errors is recommended for the optimal performance of the M2M-Net, a network that maps transcranial magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex to corresponding muscle responses, using: a finite element simulation, an empirical neural response profile, a convolutional autoencoder, a separate deep network mapper, and recordings of multi-muscle activation. We discuss the rationale behind the different modeling approaches and architectures, and contrast their results. Additionally, to obtain a comparative insight of the trade-off between complexity and performance analysis, we explore different techniques, including the extension of two classical information criteria for M2M-Net. Finally, we find that the model analogous to mapping the motor cortex stimulation to a combination of direct and synergistic connection to the muscles performs the best, when the neural response profile is used at the input. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06250">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 8	Precision Gating: Improving Neural Network Efficiency with Dynamic  Dual-Precision Activations</h3><h4>Yichi Zhang, Ritchie Zhao, Weizhe Hua, Nayun Xu, G. Edward Suh, Zhiru Zhang</h4> Abstract: We propose precision gating (PG), an end-to-end trainable dynamic dual-precision quantization technique for deep neural networks. PG computes most features in a low precision and only a small proportion of important features in a higher precision to preserve accuracy. The proposed approach is applicable to a variety of DNN architectures and significantly reduces the computational cost of DNN execution with almost no accuracy loss. Our experiments indicate that PG achieves excellent results on CNNs, including statically compressed mobile-friendly networks such as ShuffleNet. Compared to the state-of-the-art prediction-based quantization schemes, PG achieves the same or higher accuracy with 2.4$\times$ less compute on ImageNet. PG furthermore applies to RNNs. Compared to 8-bit uniform quantization, PG obtains a 1.2% improvement in perplexity per word with 2.7$\times$ computational cost reduction on LSTM on the Penn Tree Bank dataset. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07136">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 9	Query-Efficient Physical Hard-Label Attacks on Deep Learning Visual  Classification</h3><h4>Ryan Feng, Jiefeng Chen, Nelson Manohar, Earlence Fernandes, Somesh Jha, Atul Prakash</h4> Abstract: We present Survival-OPT, a physical adversarial example algorithm in the black-box hard-label setting where the attacker only has access to the model prediction class label. Assuming such limited access to the model is more relevant for settings such as proprietary cyber-physical and cloud systems than the whitebox setting assumed by prior work. By leveraging the properties of physical attacks, we create a novel approach based on the survivability of perturbations corresponding to physical transformations. Through simply querying the model for hard-label predictions, we optimize perturbations to survive in many different physical conditions and show that adversarial examples remain a security risk to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) even in the hard-label threat model. We show that Survival-OPT is query-efficient and robust: using fewer than 200K queries, we successfully attack a stop sign to be misclassified as a speed limit 30 km/hr sign in 98.5% of video frames in a drive-by setting. Survival-OPT also outperforms our baseline combination of existing hard-label and physical approaches, which required over 10x more queries for less robust results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07088">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 10	An optimal scheduling architecture for accelerating batch algorithms on  Neural Network processor architectures</h3><h4>Phani Kumar Nyshadham, Mohit Sinha, Biswajit Mishra, H S Vijay</h4> Abstract: In neural network topologies, algorithms are running on batches of data tensors. The batches of data are typically scheduled onto the computing cores which execute in parallel. For the algorithms running on batches of data, an optimal batch scheduling architecture is very much needed by suitably utilizing hardware resources - thereby resulting in significant reduction training and inference time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate the batch algorithms for neural networks through a scheduling architecture enabling optimal compute power utilization. The proposed optimal scheduling architecture can be built into HW or can be implemented in SW alone which can be leveraged for accelerating batch algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture speeds up the batch algorithms compared to the previous solutions. The proposed idea applies to any HPC architecture meant for neural networks. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.07062">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 11	Learning Architectures for Binary Networks</h3><h4>Kunal Pratap Singh, Dahyun Kim, Jonghyun Choi</h4> Abstract: Backbone architectures of most binary networks are well-known floating point architectures, such as the ResNet family. Questioning that the architectures designed for floating-point networks would not be the best for binary networks, we propose to search architectures for binary networks (BNAS). Specifically, based on the cell based search method, we define a new set of layer types, design a new cell template, and rediscover the utility of and propose to use the Zeroise layer to learn well-performing binary networks. In addition, we propose to diversify early search to learn better performing binary architectures. We show that our searched binary networks outperform state-of-the-art binary networks on CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06963">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 12	Citation Recommendation: Approaches and Datasets</h3><h4>Michael FÃ¤rber, Adam Jatowt</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation describes the task of recommending citations for a given text. Due to the overload of published scientific works in recent years on the one hand, and the need to cite the most appropriate publications when writing scientific texts on the other hand, citation recommendation has emerged as an important research topic. In recent years, several approaches and evaluation data sets have been presented. However, to the best of our knowledge, no literature survey has been conducted explicitly on citation recommendation. In this article, we give a thorough introduction into automatic citation recommendation research. We then present an overview of the approaches and data sets for citation recommendation and identify differences and commonalities using various dimensions. Last but not least, we shed light on the evaluation methods, and outline general challenges in the evaluation and how to meet them. We restrict ourselves to citation recommendation for scientific publications, as this document type has been studied the most in this area. However, many of the observations and discussions included in this survey are also applicable to other types of text, such as news articles and encyclopedic articles. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06961">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 13	Amplifying The Uncanny</h3><h4>Terence Broad, Frederic Fol Leymarie, Mick Grierson</h4> Abstract: Deep neural networks have become remarkably good at producing realistic deepfakes, images of people that are (to the untrained eye) indistinguishable from real images. These are produced by algorithms that learn to distinguish between real and fake images and are optimised to generate samples that the system deems realistic. This paper, and the resulting series of artworks Being Foiled explore the aesthetic outcome of inverting this process and instead optimising the system to generate images that it sees as being fake. Maximising the unlikelihood of the data and in turn, amplifying the uncanny nature of these machine hallucinations. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06890">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 14	Hierarchical Rule Induction Network for Abstract Visual Reasoning</h3><h4>Sheng Hu, Yuqing Ma, Xianglong Liu, Yanlu Wei, Shihao Bai</h4> Abstract: Abstract reasoning refers to the ability to analyze information, discover rules at an intangible level, and solve problems in innovative ways. Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test is typically used to examine the capability of abstract reasoning. In the test, the subject is asked to identify the correct choice from the answer set to fill the missing panel at the bottom right of RPM (e.g., a 3$\times$3 matrix), following the underlying rules inside the matrix. Recent studies, taking advantage of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have achieved encouraging progress to accomplish the RPM test problems. Unfortunately, simply relying on the relation extraction at the matrix level, they fail to recognize the complex attribute patterns inside or across rows/columns of RPM. To address this problem, in this paper we propose a Hierarchical Rule Induction Network (HriNet), by intimating human induction strategies. HriNet extracts multiple granularity rule embeddings at different levels and integrates them through a gated embedding fusion module. We further introduce a rule similarity metric based on the embeddings, so that HriNet can not only be trained using a tuplet loss but also infer the best answer according to the similarity score. To comprehensively evaluate HriNet, we first fix the defects contained in the very recent RAVEN dataset and generate a new one named Balanced-RAVEN. Then extensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale dataset PGM and our Balanced-RAVEN, the results of which show that HriNet outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06838">PDF</a>

<h3>No. 16	How to 0wn NAS in Your Spare Time</h3><h4>Sanghyun Hong, Michael Davinroy, YiÄŸitcan Kaya, Dana Dachman-Soled, Tudor DumitraÅŸ</h4> Abstract: New data processing pipelines and novel network architectures increasingly drive the success of deep learning. In consequence, the industry considers top-performing architectures as intellectual property and devotes considerable computational resources to discovering such architectures through neural architecture search (NAS). This provides an incentive for adversaries to steal these novel architectures; when used in the cloud, to provide Machine Learning as a Service, the adversaries also have an opportunity to reconstruct the architectures by exploiting a range of hardware side channels. However, it is challenging to reconstruct novel architectures and pipelines without knowing the computational graph (e.g., the layers, branches or skip connections), the architectural parameters (e.g., the number of filters in a convolutional layer) or the specific pre-processing steps (e.g. embeddings). In this paper, we design an algorithm that reconstructs the key components of a novel deep learning system by exploiting a small amount of information leakage from a cache side-channel attack, Flush+Reload. We use Flush+Reload to infer the trace of computations and the timing for each computation. Our algorithm then generates candidate computational graphs from the trace and eliminates incompatible candidates through a parameter estimation process. We implement our algorithm in PyTorch and Tensorflow. We demonstrate experimentally that we can reconstruct MalConv, a novel data pre-processing pipeline for malware detection, and ProxylessNAS- CPU, a novel network architecture for the ImageNet classification optimized to run on CPUs, without knowing the architecture family. In both cases, we achieve 0% error. These results suggest hardware side channels are a practical attack vector against MLaaS, and more efforts should be devoted to understanding their impact on the security of deep learning systems. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06776">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 17	Superpixel Segmentation via Convolutional Neural Networks with  Regularized Information Maximization</h3><h4>Teppei Suzuki</h4> Abstract: We propose an unsupervised superpixel segmentation method by optimizing a randomly-initialized convolutional neural network (CNN) in inference time. Our method generates superpixels via CNN from a single image without any labels by minimizing a proposed objective function for superpixel segmentation in inference time. There are three advantages to our method compared with many of existing methods: (i) leverages an image prior of CNN for superpixel segmentation, (ii) adaptively changes the number of superpixels according to the given images, and (iii) controls the property of superpixels by adding an auxiliary cost to the objective function. We verify the advantages of our method quantitatively and qualitatively on BSDS500 and SBD datasets. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06765">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 18	Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) -- Exploring the Linguistic  Aspects of Visual Captioning in Indian Languages (Bengali) Using MSCOCO  Framework</h3><h4>Chiranjib Sur</h4> Abstract: In this work, we have introduced Gaussian Smoothen Semantic Features (GSSF) for Better Semantic Selection for Indian regional language-based image captioning and introduced a procedure where we used the existing translation and English crowd-sourced sentences for training. We have shown that this architecture is a promising alternative source, where there is a crunch in resources. Our main contribution of this work is the development of deep learning architectures for the Bengali language (is the fifth widely spoken language in the world) with a completely different grammar and language attributes. We have shown that these are working well for complex applications like language generation from image contexts and can diversify the representation through introducing constraints, more extensive features, and unique feature spaces. We also established that we could achieve absolute precision and diversity when we use smoothened semantic tensor with the traditional LSTM and feature decomposition networks. With better learning architecture, we succeeded in establishing an automated algorithm and assessment procedure that can help in the evaluation of competent applications without the requirement for expertise and human intervention. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06701">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 19	SBERT-WK: A Sentence Embedding Method by Dissecting BERT-based Word  Models</h3><h4>Bin Wang, C.-C. Jay Kuo</h4> Abstract: Sentence embedding is an important research topic in natural language processing (NLP) since it can transfer knowledge to downstream tasks. Meanwhile, a contextualized word representation, called BERT, achieves the state-of-the-art performance in quite a few NLP tasks. Yet, it is an open problem to generate a high quality sentence representation from BERT-based word models. It was shown in previous study that different layers of BERT capture different linguistic properties. This allows us to fusion information across layers to find better sentence representation. In this work, we study the layer-wise pattern of the word representation of deep contextualized models. Then, we propose a new sentence embedding method by dissecting BERT-based word models through geometric analysis of the space spanned by the word representation. It is called the SBERT-WK method. No further training is required in SBERT-WK. We evaluate SBERT-WK on semantic textual similarity and downstream supervised tasks. Furthermore, ten sentence-level probing tasks are presented for detailed linguistic analysis. Experiments show that SBERT-WK achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Our codes are publicly available. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06652">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 20	Coresets for the Nearest-Neighbor Rule</h3><h4>Alejandro Flores Velazco, David M. Mount</h4> Abstract: The problem of nearest-neighbor condensation deals with finding a subset R from a set of labeled points P such that for every point p in R the nearest-neighbor of p in R has the same label as p. This is motivated by applications in classification, where the nearest-neighbor rule assigns to an unlabeled query point the label of its nearest-neighbor in the point set. In this context, condensation aims to reduce the size of the set needed to classify new points. However, finding such subsets of minimum cardinality is NP-hard, and most research has focused on practical heuristics without performance guarantees. Additionally, the use of exact nearest-neighbors is always assumed, ignoring the effect of condensation in the classification accuracy when nearest-neighbors are computed approximately. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing new approximation-sensitive criteria for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem, along with practical algorithms with provable performance guarantees. We characterize sufficient conditions to guarantee correct classification of unlabeled points using approximate nearest-neighbor queries on these subsets, which introduces the notion of coresets for classification with the nearest-neighbor rule. Moreover, we prove that it is NP-hard to compute subsets with these characteristics, whose cardinality approximates that of the minimum cardinality subset. Additionally, we propose new algorithms for computing such subsets, with tight approximation factors in general metrics, and improved factors for doubling metrics and l_p metrics with p >= 2. Finally, we show an alternative implementation scheme that reduces the worst-case time complexity of one of these algorithms, becoming the first truly subquadratic approximation algorithm for the nearest-neighbor condensation problem. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06650">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 21	Speech-to-Singing Conversion in an Encoder-Decoder Framework</h3><h4>Jayneel Parekh, Preeti Rao, Yi-Hsuan Yang</h4> Abstract: In this paper our goal is to convert a set of spoken lines into sung ones. Unlike previous signal processing based methods, we take a learning based approach to the problem. This allows us to automatically model various aspects of this transformation, thus overcoming dependence on specific inputs such as high quality singing templates or phoneme-score synchronization information. Specifically, we propose an encoder--decoder framework for our task. Given time-frequency representations of speech and a target melody contour, we learn encodings that enable us to synthesize singing that preserves the linguistic content and timbre of the speaker while adhering to the target melody. We also propose a multi-task learning based objective to improve lyric intelligibility. We present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of our framework. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06595">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 22	Pipeline Interventions</h3><h4>Eshwar Ram Arunachaleswaran, Sampath Kannan, Aaron Roth, Juba Ziani</h4> Abstract: We introduce the \emph{pipeline intervention} problem, defined by a layered directed acyclic graph and a set of stochastic matrices governing transitions between successive layers. The graph is a stylized model for how people from different populations are presented opportunities, eventually leading to some reward. In our model, individuals are born into an initial position (i.e. some node in the first layer of the graph) according to a fixed probability distribution, and then stochastically progress through the graph according to the transition matrices, until they reach a node in the final layer of the graph; each node in the final layer has a \emph{reward} associated with it. The pipeline intervention problem asks how to best make costly changes to the transition matrices governing people's stochastic transitions through the graph, subject to a budget constraint. We consider two objectives: social welfare maximization, and a fairness-motivated maximin objective that seeks to maximize the value to the population (starting node) with the \emph{least} expected value. We consider two variants of the maximin objective that turn out to be distinct, depending on whether we demand a deterministic solution or allow randomization. For each objective, we give an efficient approximation algorithm (an additive FPTAS) for constant width networks. We also tightly characterize the "price of fairness" in our setting: the ratio between the highest achievable social welfare and the highest social welfare consistent with a maximin optimal solution. Finally we show that for polynomial width networks, even approximating the maximin objective to any constant factor is NP hard, even for networks with constant depth. This shows that the restriction on the width in our positive results is essential. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06592">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 23	Exploring Neural Models for Parsing Natural Language into First-Order  Logic</h3><h4>Hrituraj Singh, Milan Aggrawal, Balaji Krishnamurthy</h4> Abstract: Semantic parsing is the task of obtaining machine-interpretable representations from natural language text. We consider one such formal representation - First-Order Logic (FOL) and explore the capability of neural models in parsing English sentences to FOL. We model FOL parsing as a sequence to sequence mapping task where given a natural language sentence, it is encoded into an intermediate representation using an LSTM followed by a decoder which sequentially generates the predicates in the corresponding FOL formula. We improve the standard encoder-decoder model by introducing a variable alignment mechanism that enables it to align variables across predicates in the predicted FOL. We further show the effectiveness of predicting the category of FOL entity - Unary, Binary, Variables and Scoped Entities, at each decoder step as an auxiliary task on improving the consistency of generated FOL. We perform rigorous evaluations and extensive ablations. We also aim to release our code as well as large scale FOL dataset along with models to aid further research in logic-based parsing and inference in NLP. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06544">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 24	Distributed Sketching Methods for Privacy Preserving Regression</h3><h4>Burak Bartan, Mert Pilanci</h4> Abstract: In this work, we study distributed sketching methods for large scale regression problems. We leverage multiple randomized sketches for reducing the problem dimensions as well as preserving privacy and improving straggler resilience in asynchronous distributed systems. We derive novel approximation guarantees for classical sketching methods and analyze the accuracy of parameter averaging for distributed sketches. We consider random matrices including Gaussian, randomized Hadamard, uniform sampling and leverage score sampling in the distributed setting. Moreover, we propose a hybrid approach combining sampling and fast random projections for better computational efficiency. We illustrate the performance of distributed sketches in a serverless computing platform with large scale experiments. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06538">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 25	Learning to Generate Multiple Style Transfer Outputs for an Input  Sentence</h3><h4>Kevin Lin, Ming-Yu Liu, Ming-Ting Sun, Jan Kautz</h4> Abstract: Text style transfer refers to the task of rephrasing a given text in a different style. While various methods have been proposed to advance the state of the art, they often assume the transfer output follows a delta distribution, and thus their models cannot generate different style transfer results for a given input text. To address the limitation, we propose a one-to-many text style transfer framework. In contrast to prior works that learn a one-to-one mapping that converts an input sentence to one output sentence, our approach learns a one-to-many mapping that can convert an input sentence to multiple different output sentences, while preserving the input content. This is achieved by applying adversarial training with a latent decomposition scheme. Specifically, we decompose the latent representation of the input sentence to a style code that captures the language style variation and a content code that encodes the language style-independent content. We then combine the content code with the style code for generating a style transfer output. By combining the same content code with a different style code, we generate a different style transfer output. Extensive experimental results with comparisons to several text style transfer approaches on multiple public datasets using a diverse set of performance metrics validate effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06525">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 26	Blind Adversarial Network Perturbations</h3><h4>Milad Nasr, Alireza Bahramali, Amir Houmansadr</h4> Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are commonly used for various traffic analysis problems, such as website fingerprinting and flow correlation, as they outperform traditional (e.g., statistical) techniques by large margins. However, deep neural networks are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples: adversarial inputs to the model that get labeled incorrectly by the model due to small adversarial perturbations. In this paper, for the first time, we show that an adversary can defeat DNN-based traffic analysis techniques by applying \emph{adversarial perturbations} on the patterns of \emph{live} network traffic. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06495">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 27	Learning to Group: A Bottom-Up Framework for 3D Part Discovery in Unseen  Categories</h3><h4>Tiange Luo, Kaichun Mo, Zhiao Huang, Jiarui Xu, Siyu Hu, Liwei Wang, Hao Su</h4> Abstract: We address the problem of discovering 3D parts for objects in unseen categories. Being able to learn the geometry prior of parts and transfer this prior to unseen categories pose fundamental challenges on data-driven shape segmentation approaches. Formulated as a contextual bandit problem, we propose a learning-based agglomerative clustering framework which learns a grouping policy to progressively group small part proposals into bigger ones in a bottom-up fashion. At the core of our approach is to restrict the local context for extracting part-level features, which encourages the generalizability to unseen categories. On the large-scale fine-grained 3D part dataset, PartNet, we demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge of parts learned from 3 training categories to 21 unseen testing categories without seeing any annotated samples. Quantitative comparisons against four shape segmentation baselines shows that our approach achieve the state-of-the-art performance. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06478">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 28	Monotonic Cardinality Estimation of Similarity Selection: A Deep  Learning Approach</h3><h4>Yaoshu Wang, Chuan Xiao, Jianbin Qin, Xin Cao, Yifang Sun, Wei Wang, Makoto Onizuka</h4> Abstract: Due to the outstanding capability of capturing underlying data distributions, deep learning techniques have been recently utilized for a series of traditional database problems. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of utilizing deep learning for cardinality estimation of similarity selection. Answering this problem accurately and efficiently is essential to many data management applications, especially for query optimization. Moreover, in some applications the estimated cardinality is supposed to be consistent and interpretable. Hence a monotonic estimation w.r.t. the query threshold is preferred. We propose a novel and generic method that can be applied to any data type and distance function. Our method consists of a feature extraction model and a regression model. The feature extraction model transforms original data and threshold to a Hamming space, in which a deep learning-based regression model is utilized to exploit the incremental property of cardinality w.r.t. the threshold for both accuracy and monotonicity. We develop a training strategy tailored to our model as well as techniques for fast estimation. We also discuss how to handle updates. We demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of our method through experiments, and show how it improves the performance of a query optimizer. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06442">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 29	HybridCite: A Hybrid Model for Context-Aware Citation Recommendation</h3><h4>Michael FÃ¤rber, Ashwath Sampath</h4> Abstract: Citation recommendation systems aim to recommend citations for either a complete paper or a small portion of text called a citation context. The process of recommending citations for citation contexts is called local citation recommendation and is the focus of this paper. In this paper, firstly, we develop citation recommendation approaches based on embeddings, topic modeling, and information retrieval techniques. We combine, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the best-performing algorithms into a semi-genetic hybrid recommender system for citation recommendation. We evaluate the single approaches and the hybrid approach offline based on several data sets, such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) and the MAG in combination with arXiv and ACL. We further conduct a user study for evaluating our approaches online. Our evaluation results show that a hybrid model containing embedding and information retrieval-based components outperforms its individual components and further algorithms by a large margin. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06406">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 30	An IoT-Based System: Big Urban Traffic Data Mining Through Airborne  Pollutant Gases Analysis</h3><h4>Daniel. Firouzimagham, Mohammad. Sabouri, Fatemeh. Adhami</h4> Abstract: Nowadays, in developing countries including Iran, the number of vehicles is increasing due to growing population. This has recently led to waste time getting stuck in traffic, take more time for daily commute, and increase accidents. So it is necessary to control traffic congestion by traffic police officers, expand paths efficiently and choose the best way for decreasing the traffic by citizens. Therefore, it is important to have the knowledge of instant traffic in each lane. Todays, many traffic organization services such as traffic police officer and urban traffic control system use traffic cameras, inductive sensors, satellite images, radar sensors, ultrasonic technology and radio-frequency identification (RFID) for urban traffic diagnosis. But this method has some problems such as inefficiency in heavy traffic influenced by condition of the air and inability to detect parallel traffic. Our method suggested in this article detects traffic congestion based on IOT containing a smart system that gives us traffic congestion by calculating the air pollution amount in that area. According to conducted experiment, the results were satisfied. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06374">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 31	UniViLM: A Unified Video and Language Pre-Training Model for Multimodal  Understanding and Generation</h3><h4>Huaishao Luo, Lei Ji, Botian Shi, Haoyang Huang, Nan Duan, Tianrui Li, Xilin Chen, Ming Zhou</h4> Abstract: We propose UniViLM: a Unified Video and Language pre-training Model for multimodal understanding and generation. Motivated by the recent success of BERT based pre-training technique for NLP and image-language tasks, VideoBERT and CBT are proposed to exploit BERT model for video and language pre-training using narrated instructional videos. Different from their works which only pre-train understanding task, we propose a unified video-language pre-training model for both understanding and generation tasks. Our model comprises of 4 components including two single-modal encoders, a cross encoder and a decoder with the Transformer backbone. We first pre-train our model to learn the universal representation for both video and language on a large instructional video dataset. Then we fine-tune the model on two multimodal tasks including understanding task (text-based video retrieval) and generation task (multimodal video captioning). Our extensive experiments show that our method can improve the performance of both understanding and generation tasks and achieves the state-of-the art results. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06353">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 32	Many-to-Many Voice Conversion using Conditional Cycle-Consistent  Adversarial Networks</h3><h4>Shindong Lee, BongGu Ko, Keonnyeong Lee, In-Chul Yoo, Dongsuk Yook</h4> Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) refers to transforming the speaker characteristics of an utterance without altering its linguistic contents. Many works on voice conversion require to have parallel training data that is highly expensive to acquire. Recently, the cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN), which does not require parallel training data, has been applied to voice conversion, showing the state-of-the-art performance. The CycleGAN based voice conversion, however, can be used only for a pair of speakers, i.e., one-to-one voice conversion between two speakers. In this paper, we extend the CycleGAN by conditioning the network on speakers. As a result, the proposed method can perform many-to-many voice conversion among multiple speakers using a single generative adversarial network (GAN). Compared to building multiple CycleGANs for each pair of speakers, the proposed method reduces the computational and spatial cost significantly without compromising the sound quality of the converted voice. Experimental results using the VCC2018 corpus confirm the efficiency of the proposed method. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06328">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 33	Small energy masking for improved neural network training for end-to-end  speech recognition</h3><h4>Chanwoo Kim, Kwangyoun Kim, Sathish Reddy Indurthi</h4> Abstract: In this paper, we present a Small Energy Masking (SEM) algorithm, which masks inputs having values below a certain threshold. More specifically, a time-frequency bin is masked if the filterbank energy in this bin is less than a certain energy threshold. A uniform distribution is employed to randomly generate the ratio of this energy threshold to the peak filterbank energy of each utterance in decibels. The unmasked feature elements are scaled so that the total sum of the feature values remain the same through this masking procedure. This very simple algorithm shows relatively 11.2 % and 13.5 % Word Error Rate (WER) improvements on the standard LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets over the baseline end-to-end speech recognition system. Additionally, compared to the input dropout algorithm, SEM algorithm shows relatively 7.7 % and 11.6 % improvements on the same LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other sets. With a modified shallow-fusion technique with a Transformer LM, we obtained a 2.62 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-clean set and a 7.87 % WER on the LibriSpeech test-other set. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06312">PDF</a>

It proposes a variation of Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) that formulates program exploration as sequential decisionmaking under uncertainty guided by the best-first search strategy. It relies on approximate path-preserving fuzzing, a novel instance of constrained random testing, which quickly generates many diverse inputs that likely target program parts of interest. In Test-Comp 2020, the prototype performed within 90% of the best score in 9 of 22 categories. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06311">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 35	Accurate Stress Assessment based on functional Near Infrared  Spectroscopy using Deep Learning Approach</h3><h4>Mahya Mirbagheri, Ata Jodeiri, Naser Hakimi, Vahid Zakeri, Seyed Kamaledin Setarehdan</h4> Abstract: Stress is known as one of the major factors threatening human health. A large number of studies have been performed in order to either assess or relieve stress by analyzing the brain and heart-related signals. In this study, signals produced by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) of the brain recorded from 10 healthy volunteers are employed to assess the stress induced by the Montreal Imaging Stress Task by means of a deep learning system. The proposed deep learning system consists of two main parts: First, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network is employed to build informative feature maps. Then, a stack of deep fully connected layers is used to predict the stress existence probability. Experiment results showed that the trained fNIRS model performs stress classification by achieving 88.52 -+ 0.77% accuracy. Employment of the proposed deep learning system trained on the fNIRS measurements leads to higher stress classification accuracy than the existing methods proposed in fNIRS studies in which the same experimental procedure has been employed. The proposed method suggests better stability with lower variation in prediction. Furthermore, its low computational cost opens up the possibility to be applied in real-time stress assessment. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06282">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 36	TwinBERT: Distilling Knowledge to Twin-Structured BERT Models for  Efficient Retrieval</h3><h4>Wenhao Lu, Jian Jiao, Ruofei Zhang</h4> Abstract: Pre-trained language models like BERT have achieved great success in a wide variety of NLP tasks, while the superior performance comes with high demand in computational resources, which hinders the application in low-latency IR systems. We present TwinBERT model for effective and efficient retrieval, which has twin-structured BERT-like encoders to represent query and document respectively and a crossing layer to combine the embeddings and produce a similarity score. Different from BERT, where the two input sentences are concatenated and encoded together, TwinBERT decouples them during encoding and produces the embeddings for query and document independently, which allows document embeddings to be pre-computed offline and cached in memory. Thereupon, the computation left for run-time is from the query encoding and query-document crossing only. This single change can save large amount of computation time and resources, and therefore significantly improve serving efficiency. Moreover, a few well-designed network layers and training strategies are proposed to further reduce computational cost while at the same time keep the performance as remarkable as BERT model. Lastly, we develop two versions of TwinBERT for retrieval and relevance tasks correspondingly, and both of them achieve close or on-par performance to BERT-Base model. The model was trained following the teacher-student framework and evaluated with data from one of the major search engines. Experimental results showed that the inference time was significantly reduced and was firstly controlled around 20ms on CPUs while at the same time the performance gain from fine-tuned BERT-Base model was mostly retained. Integration of the models into production systems also demonstrated remarkable improvements on relevance metrics with negligible influence on latency. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06275">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 37	Single Unit Status in Deep Convolutional Neural Network Codes for Face  Identification: Sparseness Redefined</h3><h4>Connor J. Parde, Y. Ivette ColÃ³n, Matthew Q. Hill, Carlos D. Castillo, Prithviraj Dhar, Alice J. O'Toole</h4> Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained for face identification develop representations that generalize over variable images, while retaining subject (e.g., gender) and image (e.g., viewpoint) information. Identity, gender, and viewpoint codes were studied at the "neural unit" and ensemble levels of a face-identification network. At the unit level, identification, gender classification, and viewpoint estimation were measured by deleting units to create variably-sized, randomly-sampled subspaces at the top network layer. Identification of 3,531 identities remained high (area under the ROC approximately 1.0) as dimensionality decreased from 512 units to 16 (0.95), 4 (0.80), and 2 (0.72) units. Individual identities separated statistically on every top-layer unit. Cross-unit responses were minimally correlated, indicating that units code non-redundant identity cues. This "distributed" code requires only a sparse, random sample of units to identify faces accurately. Gender classification declined gradually and viewpoint estimation fell steeply as dimensionality decreased. Individual units were weakly predictive of gender and viewpoint, but ensembles proved effective predictors. Therefore, distributed and sparse codes co-exist in the network units to represent different face attributes. At the ensemble level, principal component analysis of face representations showed that identity, gender, and viewpoint information separated into high-dimensional subspaces, ordered by explained variance. Identity, gender, and viewpoint information contributed to all individual unit responses, undercutting a neural tuning analogy for face attributes. Interpretation of neural-like codes from DCNNs, and by analogy, high-level visual codes, cannot be inferred from single unit responses. Instead, "meaning" is encoded by directions in the high-dimensional space. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06274">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 38	Social-WaGDAT: Interaction-aware Trajectory Prediction via Wasserstein  Graph Double-Attention Network</h3><h4>Jiachen Li, Hengbo Ma, Zhihao Zhang, Masayoshi Tomizuka</h4> Abstract: Effective understanding of the environment and accurate trajectory prediction of surrounding dynamic obstacles are indispensable for intelligent mobile systems (like autonomous vehicles and social robots) to achieve safe and high-quality planning when they navigate in highly interactive and crowded scenarios. Due to the existence of frequent interactions and uncertainty in the scene evolution, it is desired for the prediction system to enable relational reasoning on different entities and provide a distribution of future trajectories for each agent. In this paper, we propose a generic generative neural system (called Social-WaGDAT) for multi-agent trajectory prediction, which makes a step forward to explicit interaction modeling by incorporating relational inductive biases with a dynamic graph representation and leverages both trajectory and scene context information. We also employ an efficient kinematic constraint layer applied to vehicle trajectory prediction which not only ensures physical feasibility but also enhances model performance. The proposed system is evaluated on three public benchmark datasets for trajectory prediction, where the agents cover pedestrians, cyclists and on-road vehicles. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better performance than various baseline approaches in terms of prediction accuracy. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06241">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 39	Boosted Locality Sensitive Hashing: Discriminative Binary Codes for  Source Separation</h3><h4>Sunwoo Kim, Haici Yang, Minje Kim</h4> Abstract: Speech enhancement tasks have seen significant improvements with the advance of deep learning technology, but with the cost of increased computational complexity. In this study, we propose an adaptive boosting approach to learning locality sensitive hash codes, which represent audio spectra efficiently. We use the learned hash codes for single-channel speech denoising tasks as an alternative to a complex machine learning model, particularly to address the resource-constrained environments. Our adaptive boosting algorithm learns simple logistic regressors as the weak learners. Once trained, their binary classification results transform each spectrum of test noisy speech into a bit string. Simple bitwise operations calculate Hamming distance to find the K-nearest matching frames in the dictionary of training noisy speech spectra, whose associated ideal binary masks are averaged to estimate the denoising mask for that test mixture. Our proposed learning algorithm differs from AdaBoost in the sense that the projections are trained to minimize the distances between the self-similarity matrix of the hash codes and that of the original spectra, rather than the misclassification rate. We evaluate our discriminative hash codes on the TIMIT corpus with various noise types, and show comparative performance to deep learning methods in terms of denoising performance and complexity. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06239">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 40	Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentiment Analysis in Persian Social  Media</h3><h4>Morteza Rohanian, Mostafa Salehi, Ali Darzi, Vahid Ranjbar</h4> Abstract: With the social media engagement on the rise, the resulting data can be used as a rich resource for analyzing and understanding different phenomena around us. A sentiment analysis system employs these data to find the attitude of social media users towards certain entities in a given document. In this paper we propose a sentiment analysis method for Persian text using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a feedforward Artificial Neural Network, that categorize sentences into two and five classes (considering their intensity) by applying a layer of convolution over input data through different filters. We evaluated the method on three different datasets of Persian social media texts using Area under Curve metric. The final results show the advantage of using CNN over earlier attempts at developing traditional machine learning methods for Persian texts sentiment classification especially for short texts. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/2002.06233">PDF</a>
<h3>No. 41	Piecewise Convex Function Estimation and Model Selection</h3><h4>Kurt S. Riedel</h4> Abstract: Given noisy data, function estimation is considered when the unknown function is known apriori to consist of a small number of regions where the function is either convex or concave. When the regions are known apriori, the estimate is reduced to a finite dimensional convex optimization in the dual space. When the number of regions is unknown, the model selection problem is to determine the number of convexity change points. We use a pilot estimator based on the expected number of false inflection points. <br><a href = "http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/pdf/1803.03903">PDF</a>
